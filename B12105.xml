         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Argument of my Text is the voice of a Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, proclaiming the <hi>Messias;</hi> the <hi>oiez</hi> fits <hi>Iohn</hi> well. For the Fathers call <hi>Ecce, Praeconem Dei,</hi> Gods Cryer, and this is <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist, whom the Prophet cals a Cryer. Onely where the use of Cryers among men, is to make a triple <hi>oiez, Iohn</hi> makes his but twise. It is againe, <hi>ver.</hi> 36. For the eye is quicker, then the eare; one iteration may suffice that sense. And indeed this is not an <hi>oiez,</hi> but a <hi>voiez,</hi> the Cry is to the eye, <hi>Ecce, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Prophets cryed <hi>Ecce</hi> as well as <hi>Iohn.</hi> So did <hi>Esai, Behold a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin shall conceive.</hi> So did <hi>Zacharia, Ecce Rex tuus venit, Behold thy King commeth.</hi> But their Cry was but <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, their cry was to the eye, but to the eye of Faith. But <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist, whom our Saviour calleth more then a Prophet, his <hi>Ecce</hi> is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, not to the eye of Faith, but to the eye of flesh. <hi>Iohn</hi> that was Christs Harbenger, is his Herauld now, not to runne before him, as his <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, but to cry before him; to proclaime him to the people. That he doth here, but not in Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation stile; few words, but of force; but five in all; but like Christs five Barley loves, able to feed thousands; like <hi>Davids</hi> five smooth stones, able to fell Giants, even Sathan, the great Goliah of Hell.</p>
            <p>Doth the <hi>Oiez</hi> of a Cryer excite the eares of men; and the <hi>Ecce</hi> of a Prophet stirres it not the eyes of men? Doe we not hearken, when
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:173124:7"/> the one cryes heare; and will we not looke, when the other cries, loe. As therefore <hi>Esay,</hi> when God bad him Cry, askt, what shall I cry; so the Baptist in my Text crying <hi>Ecce, Behold,</hi> let us answer, what shall we behold? The cry containes five wordes; let us (if you please) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> five things, for every word one. The first, the <hi>Object,</hi> it is a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Lambe; <hi>Behold the Lambe.</hi> The next the <hi>Owner,</hi> it is Gods Lambe; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
               <hi>Behold the Lambe of God.</hi> The third, his <hi>act or office,</hi> it is to beare, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> for so Saint <hi>Peter</hi> consters it. The fourth, the <hi>burthen,</hi> it is sinne. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> The last, the <hi>bulke</hi> of the burthen, it is a world of sinne. <hi>Behold the Lambe of God, that beares the sinne of the world.</hi> These are the things conteined in my Text; I will speake of them severally.</p>
            <p>Doth not Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> the Evangelist call Christ a Lion? <hi>Apoc.</hi> 5. 5. Why doth Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist call him then a Lambe? The Lion and the Lambe, the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> tels us, both shall dwell together in the daies of Christ: but may they both be together in the person of Christ? not onely in one place together, but also in one case toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Different respects may tie discordant titles unto one Subject. His courage against Sathan, whom he conquered, his patience among men, whom he suffered, declared there was met in one <hi>Messias,</hi> the stoutnesse of a Lion, and the meekenesse of a Lambe. Saint <hi>Bernards</hi> distinction so determines it, <hi>Agnus in passione, Leo in resurrectione,</hi> he rose like a Lion, but he suffered like a Lambe.</p>
            <p>Christ askes in the Gospell, <hi>Whereunto shall I liken the Kingdome of God?</hi> I may much rather aske, whereunto shall I liken the Sonne of God? <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptist doth liken him here unto a Lambe; the fairest of all men, so <hi>David</hi> calleth Christ, to the best of all beasts: so <hi>Philo</hi> cales the Lambe, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the best of the brute Creatures. A name, not newly founded, nor onely used by the Baptist. Both <hi>Esay</hi> before him, the Evangelicall Prophet, and Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> after him, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall Evangelist, almost in every Chapter of his <hi>Revelation,</hi> hath called Christ, the Lambe. All three of them doe grace it with a note of demonstration, the Prophet and Evangelist with an article alone, but the Baptist in my Text, with a particle besides, <hi>Behold the Lambe;</hi> both of them demonstrative; yea which is not easie to parallel in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, article upon article; every word hath one; <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Surely we must thinke, where the spirit hath beene pleased to make so many markes, that the matter is remarkeable; wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy both the preachers carefull paines, and the peoples heedfull eares, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the Lambe. Christ was <hi>Agnus singulariter. Aug. tract. 7. in Ioan. col.</hi> 62.</p>
            <p>You that are learned, I would not with your leave, lose the article. Christ saith, that one <hi>iota</hi> shall not faile of his word: shall not an <hi>I,</hi> and shall not an <hi>O?</hi> It is indeed a little one; but it waites on him, that cals himselfe a great one. <hi>I am Alpha and Omega,</hi> saith this Lambe in the <hi>Apocalypse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Behold the Lambe;</hi> What Lambe? As the name is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> so the note is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, it hath relation to the Lambe in the law; the famous Paschall Lambe, the type of the <hi>Messias.</hi> Looke at that Lambe, and see our Saviour. The blood of that Lambe striken with Hyssope
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:173124:7"/> on the doorepostes of their houses, preserved the people from the plague of the destroyer. The bunche of Hysope is the type of faith, which dipped in Christs death, and stricken on our hearts, the houses of our soules, preserves the same from sathan, and all the powers of Hell. And therefore as that Lambe was called the Passeover; so is also Christ. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 7. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> cals him our Passeover. The Article in this place alludes to this Lambe, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the Lambe.</p>
            <p>Yet the aime of the Article is not at that Lambe alone. The Law hath other Lambes, some for the daily sacrifice, some for trespasses, and some for peace: but all for one maine purpose, to be reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and propitiations, and ransoms for sinne; but all in type. The truth, and substance, and body of them all, is hee, whom saint <hi>Iohn</hi> heere pointeth at. Christ is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, he is the Lambe. And therefore all those termes, reconciliation, propitiation, ransome, and peace, are all by the Apostles conferred upon Christ. Those Lambes were but signifiers, shaddowes, and resemblances of Christ to come; whom now being come, the Baptist points at in my Text; and his finger is the article, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Behold the Lambe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And why a Lambe? Was not the goate and bullocke among the beasts, and the dove and turtle among the foules, used in the Law to be offered to the Lord, as well as the Lambe? Surely this holy man of God spake as he was guided by the Holy Ghost. That Holy Ghost, which doth all things <hi>numero, mensura, pondere,</hi> that numbreth, and measureth, and pondereth all things, words as well as workes, hath in precise proportion made choise of the Lambe before the other beastes, as the fittest of them all. Hee that was to yeeld a double obedience, both active to the Law, and passive to the Curse, both by his holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to merit life for us, and in his lowlinesse to suffer death for us, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved him to be both <hi>innocentissimus,</hi> and <hi>patientissimus;</hi> and so of all brute creatures, likest to the Lambe, the meekest and most harmeles of the beasts. Christ for these two causes, heere is cald a Lambe; a Lambe, both for his Innocency, and his Meeknesse: so harmelesse, that he never hurt others; so meeke that he resisted not any that hurt him.</p>
            <p>First for his Innocency, let his Iudge judge that, <hi>Iohn 18. Behold I finde no fault at all in him.</hi> Surely <hi>Pilate</hi> was not partiall. Or say hee was, Sathan himselfe, Christs dea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>liest enemy, who seekes to sift men, <hi>Luk. 22. He sought, but could not finde. Iohn 14. Non habet in me quicquam, he could finde no fault in him.</hi> [And therefore saint <hi>Peter</hi> calleth him a Lambe, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>sine macula, sine momo;</hi> not onely without sinne, but without any darer to charge him with sinne. All men have their <hi>Momos,</hi> their Censurers, be they never so upright; that rather then faile, if they finde no vice, will carpe at vertue. But Christ was without chalenger. Yea the Councell to condemne him, were faine to seeke false witnesses, but could finde none: <hi>and though many came, yet found they none,</hi> saith the Evangelist. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> himselfe could find no fault in him.] Not in his hands, <hi>Peccatum non fecit, he did no sinne,</hi> saith <hi>Peter.</hi> Not in his mouth; there was no guile in it. Not in his heart: though sathans siffe could not come there, yet the Apostle cleares that too, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>our Saviour
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:173124:8"/> knew no sinne.</hi> And therefore whereas others are called holy, saint <hi>Augustine</hi> cals Christ <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum,</hi> the holiest of the holy; for he was wholly holy. So he singes unto his spouse, who better might have sung it unto him, Thou art all faire, my Love, and there is no spot in thee. Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> hath the generall, 1 <hi>Epist. 3. 6. In him was no sinne.</hi> Not actuall sinne; <hi>Peccatorum dimissor, non commissor, Aug.</hi> a bearer of sinne, in my Text, a forbearer of sinne, saith that Father, but no doer of sinne. Not originall sinne; saint <hi>Augustine</hi> was but a young Divine, when he feared to beleeve in Christ, <hi>in carne natum,</hi> for feare he should be forc't to beleeve also in him, <hi>ex carne inquinatum.</hi> For Christs conception was by the holy Ghost, and his seed was sanctified, though in a sinners wombe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, for Meekenesse, he might be cald a Lambe, <hi>which Philo cals <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the meekest, and mildest, and gentlest of the beasts.</hi> That whereas every creature hath some curstnesse in his kind, even the smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest flye his spleen, and the little ant his gall, the Baptist hath singled out the Lambe, to resemble our Saviour unto it, which <hi>Philo</hi> cals <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>the meekest, the mildest, the gentlest of the Creatures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The sheepe is led unto the slaughter without strife, <hi>and the Lambe</hi> (saith the Prophet) <hi>is dumbe before the shearer.</hi> Christ was led to <hi>Gab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batha,</hi> to <hi>Golgotha,</hi> to the one to be shorne; to the other to be slaine, without resistance, without clamour. To be shorne? nay to be torne. It sufficed not his persecutors to fleece him only, but they would flea him too. His coate sufficed them not; but they rent his skinne. The sheepe shearer cares not to clippe the wooll, but hee will not cut the skinne. They had pitty on his coate, but no pitty on his body. His coate they would not cut, but cast lots for it whole. But they tore his skinne with scourges, and the whips, like ploughes made furrowes on his backe. Nay neither did his skinne content their cruelty; but as thinking that torture to be but superficiall, they digged deepe into his flesh; and as the <hi>Psalme</hi> saith of <hi>Ioseph,</hi> the iron entered into his very soule.</p>
            <p>Thus tortured, thus martired, as never any shearer, never any slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-man handled any Lambe, yet like that Lambe in <hi>Esay,</hi> he bore all their Butchery with silent patience, without clamour, without strife. St. <hi>Peter</hi> showes the one, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, when he was reviled, he reviled not againe. And for the other, a sword was drawne, and a man maimed at Christs reprehension; but it was not with Christs will, who cured the maime, and rebuked the Disciple. An extraordinary pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to suffer wrong, indignity, extremity, to suffer it with silence; without mone, without grone. It is more then mans patience; flesh and bloud are not able to doe it. Tell me not of <hi>Moses:</hi> I know the Scripture cals him the meekest man on Earth. But did he not murmure at the waters of <hi>Meribah?</hi> Tell me not of <hi>Iob.</hi> You have heard (saith saint <hi>Iames</hi>) of <hi>Iobs</hi> patience. Nay let us rather hearken to Christs pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, farre beyond <hi>Iobs, Iob</hi> suffered much, but not in silence: hee curst, and he complained. But our Saviour Christ in the admirable strength of his incomparable patience, <hi>Like a Lambe</hi> (saith the Prophet) <hi>dumbe before his shearer, not once opened his mouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:173124:8"/>
            <p>Say not I <hi>hyperbolize;</hi> it is Gods spirits speech, and it is not hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolicall. Surely our Saviour opened his mouth; yea he spake seaven sundry times upon the Crosse. But he spake not one word against his persecutours. Nay he prayed for them expressely, <hi>Father forgive them, they know not what they doe.</hi> That as we use to say of one, that yeelds up his Ghost quietly, without strugling with death, that hee dyed like a Lambe; so we may say of Christ above all the sonnes of men, for his matchlesse meekenesse in all his martyrdome, yea and his peereles patience in the pangs of death, that he departed like a Lambe. I am too long in this point; I come unto the next; I will be very short in it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Behold the Lambe:</hi> what Lambe? <hi>the Lambe of God.</hi> Hee, who is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> called by Saint <hi>Paul, Christus Dei, the Christ of God,</hi> is here called by the Baptist, <hi>Agnus Dei, the Lambe of God,</hi> The phrase is unusuall, found onely in this Chapter. Both Prophets and Evangelists call Christ a Lambe; but never was he called Gods Lambe, but by <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptist. And why Gods Lambe? are not all Lambes the Lords? So sayes the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> that all the beasts of the forest are his, and so are the cattell upon a thousand hills.</p>
            <p>The different senses guessed by Divines, it shall not skill to cite, save onely one; that as offrings and sacrifices are called theirs in Scripture, who presented them; so Christ is called Gods Lambe, because hee offered him. The Lambe, which <hi>Abel</hi> offered, is called <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> his sacrifice. <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. The bullocke; which the people were to offer for their sinne, <hi>Levit.</hi> 4. is called there by <hi>Moses</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples sinne offring. Christ being Gods sacrifice, offred by Gods selfe, is justly called Gods Lambe. For God gave Christ, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 16. that <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the Fathers say, <hi>dedit, idest, tradidit,</hi> God delivered him, more to the word, God did <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, God did offer him; I say, God delivered him, God offered him, God sacrificed him for sinne. A worke of wonder, and worthy of an <hi>Ecce.</hi> God to whom belongs all offering, now to be himselfe an offerer. And say, he would be so; had he nought to offer but his Sonne? <hi>O Altitudo!</hi> Oh the depth of the riches of the love of God! was there no ransome for the sinne of man, but onely the offring of the Sonne of God? Sufficed it not for sinne to sacrifice a Lambe; but must it also be the Lambe of God? Must the Altar be a Crosse? and must Christ be the <hi>Crucifixe?</hi> and was there no other to offer him, but God? the Father so farre to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get all affection, to sacrifice his Sonne?</p>
            <p>Such was Gods love, such was mans sinne, as imposed an <hi>oportet</hi> upon both persons: <hi>O portuit Christum pati,</hi> saith himselfe; it behoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved both Christ to be the sufferer, and God to be the offerer. The Lambes in the Law were but onely for the Iewes; and that but for a time; and that not of any worth, or vertue in themselves: but that God so accepted them. They served in that sort, being but the Lambes of men. But he, that should beare the sinne of a world, both a world of people, and a world of time, must be the Lambe of God. The loade of that sinne was too heavy to be laid on the Lambes in the Law, which

            <p>The next point is the Act; <hi>that Beareth.</hi> The originall terme hath two <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> translations, to beare, or to take away. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> parallels the former<note place="margin">α</note> sense, himselfe bore our sinnes (saith the Apostle) in his body A frequent phrase in the old Testament, signifying commonly the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, or the punishment of sinne. Christ bore it both wayes; both the name of it, <hi>He was reckoned with the wicked:</hi> and the paine of it, Gods curse, and death. <hi>Esay</hi> hath them both together, <hi>cap. 53. He bore our infirmities,</hi> there is the guilt, <hi>and carried our sorrowes,</hi> there is the paine.</p>
            <p>First for the imputation: the Prophet hath exprest it, <hi>Cum sceleratis reputatus est,</hi> there is the very terme. The Gospel translates it, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. He whom <hi>S. Peter</hi> calls <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, <hi>i.</hi> spotlesse, was accounted <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, with the lawlesse. Christ is the scape-goate in the law, upon which were laid all the sinnes of the people. They did them, but the goate bore them. So the Prophet saith of Christ, All our iniquities the Lord hath laid on him, <hi>Esa.</hi> 53. 6. Wee acted them, but Christ carryed them. God hath remooved them from us to Christ. The bond of our handwriting, the record of our sinnes, Christ nailed it to his Crosse. Wee are freed from the debt: our Saviours <hi>Assumpsit</hi> hath discharged us. We stand before God, but in the Lambes livery, our robe of righteousnes is woven of his wooll, and we may say to Christ, as Christ said to his Father, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, all thy things are mine, and all my things are thine. Christs merits are made ours, and our sins are made his. <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. 10.</p>
            <p>Now for the execution; the beasts in the Law, that were slaine to be sacrificed, dyed not for themselves. The death was due to them, in whose names they were offered. Christ, whom they signified, suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for sinne, both torture, and slaughter, both in our stead. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle therefore saith, <hi>Christ was made sinne, id est.</hi> a sinne offering; the Fathers so conster it. I say not, Christ suffered all that we should: but all that Christ suffered, he suffered for us: the wrath of God, the curse of God, ignominie and death. His wrath; Christ cryed in the sense of it, <hi>My God, My God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> But that cry should have beene ours, and every sinner deserves to cry with <hi>David, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> Gods curse: Christ (saith the Apostle) was made a curse, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13. but it followes there, for us. Shame; <hi>the rebukes</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>of them that rebuke thee, fell upon me. Rom.</hi> 15. the rebukes were ours, but they lighted upon him. And for Death, <hi>Messias</hi> (saith <hi>Daniel</hi>) shall be slaine, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, but not for himselfe. Death was our debt: but it pleased him to pay it, that did not owe it. <hi>Mortem, quam non debebat, exolvit,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this is not all; there was a further debt was due to us; Hell and Damnation; Did he beare that too? I say it not, the Fathers say it not, the Scriptures say it not. Some late Divines have said it, whom I
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:173124:9"/> censure not, that Christ suffered Hell in his soule. But let me tell you what Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>Quis audeat dicere,</hi> who dareth be so bold (saith that Father) as to say, that Christ suffered Hell in his soule? I once before referd you, so doe I now againe, to Bishop <hi>Bilsons</hi> booke, written of this point largely and learnedly.</p>
            <p>Or haply doe you like the other Translation, that taketh away,<note place="margin">β</note> &amp;c. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> a simple sinner, hearing Christ fell thrice under the burthen of the Crosse, may feare, lest he fall under the burthen of my sinne; and so God may take it up, and lay it on me againe; and therefore call ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the other translation, that takes away my sinne. Say then the <hi>Ferre</hi> is <hi>Auferre,</hi> he hath taken it away.</p>
            <p>Sundry other phrases equipollent unto this, are found in holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; the covering of sinne, the purging it, the healing it, the washing it, Gods not remembring it, Gods hiding his face from it, his casting it behind his backe, his throwing it into the bottome of the Sea; all of them comfortable, but none of them sounding so sweetly, as this heere. Sinne to be covered, will not serve; for God may uncover it, for saith not our Saviour, <hi>Nihil est occultum, quod non revelabitur? Nothing is so covered, but shall be revealed.</hi> Nor will it serve to purge it; in purging any humour, some still remaines behind. Else why is the Popes pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, if Christ had purged sinne cleane? Washing will not serve; there are some staines, that will not out with washing. Healing will not serve; relapse may worke worse danger then before. Will not God remember it? how can that be? for God can not forget, or though he could; yet our sinnes are recorded; and when the bookes shall be opened, his rolles will remember him. Say God doe hide his face from it; God hath eares as well as eyes. Sinne is a cryer; it will up unto his eare. Or though it selfe be silent, yet Sathan is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>i. e.</hi> a promoter; he will informe. But God will cast it behind his backe, neither will that serve: For he is <hi>totus oculus,</hi> saith the Father, and hath eyes behind as well as before, <hi>Rev.</hi> 4. 6. Lastly, God will throw it into the bottome of the Sea: All will not serve. For at the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, when the Sea shall be burnt up, Sinne will then be seene. Yea at the last day, when the Sea is summoned to give up her dead; sinne haply will up with all. Or if it doe not, yet rather then faile, the devill himselfe will dive to fetch it up to judgement. Thus may foolish flesh little skilled in Scripture, object against those phrases. But this terme in my Text, to take away sinne, it takes away all argument, and the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners soule is satisfied with it. <hi>Psal.</hi> 10. 15. Take away mine ungodlinesse, and thou shalt find none.</p>
            <p>Christ hath not then borne onely, but he hath taken away our sinne. Yea least the terme Originall might scrupulise the sinner by the dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble sense; Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Colossians,</hi> 2. 14. Hath put a glosse unto it, to doe away all doubt. Our <hi>Chirographum, i. e.</hi> the Bill of our hand, Our Bill of debt, that is, of sinne, Christ hath not onely cancelled it, that is, raced it with a few crosse lines, and so left it in the Creditours hands; but to make all sure, he hath taken it out. So it is there, not onely <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, hee hath utterly abolisht it.</p>
            <p>What? will you say, doth not the Preacher presse the terme too farre? hath the Lambe of God quite taken sinne away? What say you to Concupiscence? either you must say, it is no sinne, and that were Popery: or you must relent from the strictnesse of the terme, that Christ doth not utterly take away sinne. For Concupiscence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines in us, in us all, all our life. It is the devils indeleble Character, which is never wholy done out till death.</p>
            <p>I answer; there are two things considerable in sinne, the strength of it, and the sting of it. The sting is twofold, for Sinne, like a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, hath a biforked taile, <hi>reatus &amp; supplicium,</hi> the guilt, and the paine. The guilt I call the incurring of the sentence, the desert of death. The paine is damnation. Both these the Lambe hath taken quite away. The beleever on that Lambe, is not so much as <hi>Reus, i. e.</hi> liable to the paine. The <hi>Obligatio ad poenam, i. e.</hi> the Imputation, God hath laid it on the Lambe And if the Imputation, then by consequent the paine.</p>
            <p>Now for the other, the strength of sinne, the activity of that in-bred corruption, which both it selfe is sinne originally, and the source also of all actuall sinne, Gods Lambe hath taken that away too: Not the whole vigour of it, but the maine rigour of it. He hath not remooved Concupiscence it selfe; but her power he hath abated, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap> bred in us; so incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated in our substance, that it is cald our Flesh, the Lambe of God hath taken it away. Not, <hi>ut non sit,</hi> but <hi>ut non praesit, ut non obsit;</hi> not from being in us, but from ruling in us, and from hurting us. The site of it Christ hath not stird: but the might and spight of it, hee hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken them away; the might that it shall not <hi>regnare;</hi> the spight that it shall not <hi>damnare.</hi> Sinne dwels in all, but it doth not reigne in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate.

               </gap>, present tenses are most active; the tense here doth argue the Act to bee perpetuall, that doth beare it, <hi>i. e.</hi> that is alwaies bearing it; the act but once, but the effect for ever. Christ is <hi>heri, hodie, &amp; semper idem,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>Yesterday, to day, and ever the same.

Christ sits beside his Father; and the sufferings of his Sonne are ever in his sight, and the <hi>Psalmes</hi> are excellent, though censured by some, both the Sinners Lamentation, and his humble sute,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:173124:10"/> in which he sings of Christ, his bloudy wounds are yet to see, and that his blood is not yet dry. And I will prescribe to none, but I verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, that the scarres of Christs wounds are yet still in his body; and what is <hi>Cicatrix,</hi> but <hi>vulneris refricatrix,</hi> scarres the present prints, and fresh remembrancers of old wounds? Christ dyed but once, but the vertue of his death is such to man, that he may say with <hi>Paul, I die daily.</hi> I say, Christs suffering, his offering was not often, it was but once: but by that one oblation; my Sire, my selfe, my seed, <hi>id est,</hi> time past, time present, and time to come, are freed from their sinnes.</p>
            <p>To end this third point, <hi>Behold the Lambe of God, that beares, &amp;c.</hi> How doth he beare? Saint <hi>Peter</hi> tels us how, he bore them on his body. Burthens are borne on the necke and shoulders: he bore the loade of sinne in his whole body: every part had a part of it; from head to foote; yea from the crowne of his head, to the sole of his foote. For the thornes were platted on the top of his head, and the naile went through the bottome of his feete: His body bore it every way, <hi>sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum, imum, medium;</hi> the Crowne above, the naile beneath, the speare in the midst. Before, behind: his backe scourged, his brest gaged; On the right hand, on the le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t, his armes expanded, and nailed to the Crosse. Nay his burthen was not confined with his body; neither head, nor feet, nor hands did determine them. Though he were ret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched and stretched to the uttermost straine, as it were upon a racke, that as the <hi>Psalmist</hi> speaketh, they might tell all his bones; yet his loade went beyond the dimension of his Limmes, was longer, and dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and broader then his body. For a title was over his head, that upbraided him; the people were under his feete; they derided him; and the theeves aloofe on each side disparaged him. For he hanging in the midst, and that (as some write) upon a higher tree, then they, appeared to the people, a mainer malefactour, and offender worse then they. Nay Saint <hi>Peter</hi> saith not all, when he saith, that he bore our sinne on his body: his soule also felt the weight of it. The burthen not onely pressed his body, but it sadded his soule; <hi>My Soule</hi> (saith our Saviour) <hi>is sad unto the death.</hi> The sense of the unsupportable waight of it, sinking to his soule, both forced from his face drops of bloud in the garden, and wrested from his mouth that strong cry upon the Crosse; <hi>Eli, Eli, Lammah sabachthani, My God, my God, Why hast thou forsaken me?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fourth point is the Burthen. Sinne is the heaviest thing in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> world. What creature so ever it is in, it sinkes him downe to hell. The earth by Philosophy is the Center of all weight; there is no heavy body, but it resteth there. But sinne is so weighty that the earth can not beare it; it seekes a lower Center, and it sinkes the Creature downe unto hell. The sinne of schisme in <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> could not rest on earth; the ground was faine to open, and let them downe to hell. Nay Angels themselves, the lightest of Gods creatures, yet sinne waighed them downe, as the Prophet speaketh, from the sides of the North, to the sides of the pit: to the sides? Nay to the bottome of that bottomlesse pit, to the nethermost hell. What needs <hi>David</hi> say,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:173124:11"/>
               <hi>Psalme 18. funes inferni,</hi> the ropes of hell. Sinne needs no haling; it is so heavy, that it fals downe headlong into hell.</p>
            <p>Sinne is a heavy burthen; <hi>Cain</hi> complained of it: <hi>My sinne is heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, then I can beare. David</hi> complained of it, <hi>Psalme</hi> 38 <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> they were too sad for him. What cite I men and Angels; God himselfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate, Christ complained of it. It made him sweate under it, and the sweate was bloud. Yea it made him grone under it, as a wagon groneth, that is ful of sheaves. Nay it made him cry out under it, <hi>cum clamore vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do, Heb.</hi> 5. with a strong cry, <hi>My God, my God, &amp;c.</hi> What should I la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to amplifie the weight of it? It is like the weight of glory, 2 <hi>Cor,</hi> 4. 17. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, words cannot utter it, for wit cannot i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine it. This loade, this Lambe, this day, hath borne for us; Marveile not at <hi>Samson,</hi> that bore the gates of <hi>Azzah;</hi> here is a Lambe, that bore the gates of hell.</p>
            <p>The burthen of sinne, you have heard the weight of it, may it please you now to see the bulke of it. It is the sinne of the world. When sinne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> is singlest, it is heavy then. One breach of one law weighes downe to hell. If sinne shall grow in number, the loade must grow in weight. But when numbers doe sinne, what is the burthen▪ then? The loade which the Lambe hath adventured to beare; it is not of one sinne, it is not of many sinnes, nay not the many sinnes of many, but all the sinnes of all, the sinnes of the whole world. A terme of large extent; take it <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap> God hath made them meete in Christ. God hath made Christ the center of all sinnes.</p>
            <p>For altogether, Christ joynes with <hi>Iohn</hi> in the generality, Christs cry with <hi>Iohns</hi> cry, <hi>Venite ad me omnes, Come unto me all;</hi> all now, all hereafter: all here, all every where; all of all conditions, <hi>omnes labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantes, all that are heavy laden, and I will refresh you;</hi> your sins are your burthens, I will beare them for you all. His armes argued as much at his passion. He displaid them wide upon the Crosse, as it were to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace, whosoever would come to him. For shall the power of the first <hi>Adam</hi> be stronger unto death, then the second unto life? Nay, but as <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>Omnes, sicut Adam tabificavit, ita Christus justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit, as by one man,</hi> the man <hi>Adam, Sinne entred into the world, and caught hold of all;</hi> so also by one man, the man Christ, the grace of God, by the Lambe of God, hath abounded unto all.</p>
            <p>Shall we see it in the severals? I will be short in them. First for <hi>times:</hi> Saith not Christs selfe, that he was before <hi>Abraham?</hi> His Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple saith more, that the slaughter of this Lambe was from the worlds beginning. Even <hi>Adam</hi> and his wife, the first sinners upon earth, had their sinne borne by Christ. God said, <hi>Their seed shall break the Serpents head.</hi> Yet bore he not theirs onely, and all the times before him, as the nature of satisfaction is for trespasse past; but for ages also after him, for us, and our posterity, his <hi>passio</hi> was <hi>propassio, he suffered before hand for our Sinnes.</hi>

As the Angell saith, <hi>Natus est vobis,</hi> he was borne to them, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 11. so the Prophet saith, <hi>natus est nobis, A Child is borne to us. Esay</hi> 9. 6. That Child was called Iesus, because he should save his people from their sins. His people? they were Iewes. But so are Gentiles too. The Prophet <hi>O see</hi> tels us, <hi>Loammi</hi> was made <hi>Ammi,</hi> God said to Heathens, <hi>Populus meus tu,</hi> all nations are my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.

That Lambe, when he bore mans sinne upon the Crosse, he suffered in the East: but whether did he looke, whether did he point? <hi>His face was to the Sea.,</hi> and his fingers pointed North and South: And the blood of his body, in which he bare our sinne, flowing every way, was an embleme of salvation shewing every way, His backe behind, his face and feet before, his hands on either side, shed forth a ransome for nations round about, and washt away the sinnes of all quarters under Heaven. <hi>Vide Theophilact. in Mat.</hi> 27. 33. So saith saint <hi>Augustine, Passio Domini, pretium est Orbis,</hi> the passion of the Lambe was the ransome of the Earth, and Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> in his Epistle, Christ is the reconciler of the sinnes of the whole world.

            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE argument of my Text is according to the Day, the Nativity of Christ, three words in the Originall, a Person, Who? <hi>a Child;</hi> an Action, What? <hi>is Borne;</hi> the Purpose, Why? <hi>for us.</hi> These three Questions my theame, Who? What? and Why? Who the Child? God. What the Birth? his taking Flesh. Why for us? for our Salvation. God was Incarnate, to save Man. Thats the Paraphrase of my Text, and the summe of all that I shal say.</p>
            <p>For the first, <hi>a Child.</hi> The English word is ambiguous, makes no distinction betweene Sexe or Age. Whom we beare or beget, wee call our Children, whether Sonnes, or Daughters, yong or old. In the learned tongues it is not so; they difference both. The Child here is for Age, an Infant; and for Sexe a Sonne.</p>
            <p>For the one, When Christ would take our Flesh; he would not be a Woman, but a Man. To bee true Man, it skild not, whether Sexe he should assume. Women are mankind, as well as Men; each of equall perfection, and in Gods love alike, and each made in Gods Image. But some preheminence God gave the Man above the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; the rather for her tempting him to fall. <hi>Paul</hi> saies, he is her head, &amp; she the weaker vessell. That knew the Serpent, and therefore tempted her, not him. It pleased God therefore to take Flesh, though of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, yet in the Mans Sexe. Not that the Womans Sexe dispara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his Deity; but that his wisdome found it fit: Why; I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire not.</p>
            <p>For the other, God might have made a body, have created it of earth, as he did <hi>Adams,</hi> a mans body of full growth; and have brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed a living soule in it; and so have assumed it to his Godhead. He
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:173124:12"/> rather chose to be <hi>Parvulus, a Child. Paul</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> have two words, both of C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <hi>Pauls</hi> word of God is but <hi>exinanivit</hi> he emptied himselfe. But he did more, <hi>Annihilavit,</hi> made himselfe almost nothing. God would not onely be Man, though a state farre under God. For a man may be great; the Sons of <hi>Anack</hi> were, the <hi>Amorite</hi> was, tall as the Cedar, sturdy as the Oke. But he would bee also the weakest of men. So is the Child, the new borne babe.</p>
            <p>The weakest of men? the weakest of all Creatures; <hi>Vermis Ego,</hi> I am a worme, saies <hi>David.</hi> The worme is not so weake, as the new borne Child is: The Sonne of <hi>David</hi> would be weaker, then the worme. The worme creepes, the Child cannot. Every beasts yong ones finde the dammes teates: the Child does not, the n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ple must be put into the mouth. Such a man would God be, <hi>a Child.</hi> Christ is cald thus in the Prophets but once onely; but in the Gospell almost twenty times. An Angell cals him an Infant; St. <hi>Luke,</hi> the Child Iesus. His food, a Childs, Butter and Honie, <hi>Esay</hi> 7. His understanding too, want of wit to discerne betweene good and evill.</p>
            <p>This hath seemed to some so unbeseeming God, that <hi>Nestorius</hi> said flatly, he never would acknowledge <hi>bimestrem aut trimestrem Deum,</hi> call an Infant God, of two or three moneths old. But he that scorned not to be Man, disdained not to be like to Man, in all things, saving sinne, Groweth in the Wombe, Birth out of it, to sucke the breast, be laid in cradle, swathed in cloathes, borne in armes, suffer and doe all things, this heavenly Sonne of Man, like all earthly Sons of Women. In some of these particulars, Papists doe oppose; which I passe by, as not much pertinent. All worthy the wonderment, the amazement of all men. Of which, more; when I shall have treated of the next word, which doth necessitate this. <hi>Esay</hi> addes, <hi>Natus est, Is Borne:</hi> that cannot be, except a Child. I come therefore to that. <hi>A Child is Borne.</hi> For never did Womans wombe deliver a Man growne. A Camell goes not through a needles eye. Bee that the first scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the second word, <hi>Natus est, is Borne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Bearing presumes the opening of the Wombe. That Christ did not, Papists say, some Fathers too. But moe say, that he did, Papists rejoyne, that they said it <hi>Pio sensu.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the thing seeme absurd, that a Child should so be borne: they maintaine, Christs birth was so by especiall dispensation, and Gods omnipotent power. By which, Christs body rising, passed through the graves stone, risen (the dores being shut) yet went in to his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; and now is in the Sacrament at once in many places. All alike true. Better, leave this scruple, then discourse it. Heare an other.</p>
            <p>Neare kinne to it, is <hi>Mari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s</hi> Virginity; a Virgin beare a Child? That Nature denies, Heathens deride: but needes no proofe, all Christians beleeving it. They have reason. Scripture avouches it. That one should, the Prophet saies, <hi>Esay</hi> 7. 14. That one did, the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell saies, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. 7. I will say with St. <hi>Austin, Tu disputa; ego credam,</hi> Dispute it, who so lists; I will beleeve it.</p>
            <p>But why <hi>Natus, Borne?</hi> Sufficed not <hi>Incarnatus,</hi> Christs taking flesh? <hi>Iohn</hi> saies, the Word tooke flesh, <hi>Verbum Caro factum est.</hi> Thats

               </gap>ought it otherwise: but he had decreed, it should be thus. <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> both were Incarnate; neither Borne. But Christ was Promist to come of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans seed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. Her wombe must Breed and Beare him. He would honour our Condition, and hold it no disparage to his Divine Person, to be called the Sonne of Man. Every Sonne in prime and proper sense is Borne. There are Sonnes by Adoption, and some otherwaies: but the terme so is but Metaphor.</p>
            <p>But why <hi>Natus est, Is Borne?</hi> How is that true? Christ was not yet <hi>Incarnate;</hi> not borne in <hi>Esaies</hi> daies, not 700. yeares after. An un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned Atheist would say, either he lyed; or meant his <hi>Natus est,</hi> of some other, not of Christ▪ If you read the first of <hi>Matthew,</hi> you shall find almost twenty generations betweene <hi>Esaies</hi> age, and Christs birth. But <hi>Esay</hi> lyes not, but speakes heere from Gods Spirit: who by the Prophets often delivers things to come, as if already past. But especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in <hi>Esay,</hi> whom the Fathers therefore call, not so much a Prophet as rather an Evangelist, an Evangelicall Prophet. As heere of Christs Nativity, so else where of his death, of all our Saviours sufferings, he writes, as of things past already. As heere <hi>Natus est,</hi> so there <hi>vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neratus est, attritus est, abscissus est,</hi> and many more in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. <hi>David</hi> long before <hi>Esay</hi> did the like. This phrase therefore of <hi>Esaies</hi> the Gospell often iterates. The wise men in St. <hi>Matthew, Vbi est, qui natus est? Where is he, that is borne King of the Iewes?</hi> The Angell in Saint <hi>Luke, Natus est vobis, there is borne to you a Saviour.</hi> The Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> heere is not <hi>Testis singularis:</hi> Prophets and Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists, Angels and Apostles are Contests unto <hi>Esay.</hi> Enough of each word thus apart: weigh we them now joyntly, but with wonderment: they are well worthy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A Child is Borne.</hi> Child-birth is ordinary; there is no wonder in it, and yet there is. Though it seeme meerely naturall; God hath in every birth his admirable worke. Though the babes body bee but small; yet the way of birth is so unpassable; that every Child would cost the mothers life, and die it selfe too in the delivery; nay there would be no delivery at all; did not Gods though usuall, yet admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable grace assist the Act by speciall providence.

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a Greeke Father saies, a most incredible thing. The Word, who is God, to become flesh; God who is a Spirit, to assume a body; Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty to put on Mortality, Power to turne infirmity; God to become Man; this is (as the Poet speakes) <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to bring hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven downe to earth. The earth wondered at Christs Nativity, to see a new Starre in Heaven. But Heaven might rather wonder to see a new Sunne on earth.</p>
            <p>The first Word, raises all this wonder: the second addes more to it. You heare, <hi>Quis Puer,</hi> who the Child is: aske <hi>Vnde Natus,</hi> who bore this Child? The <hi>Nicen</hi> Creed saies, <hi>Deus de Deo,</hi> God must be borne of God. So was God the Word, of God the Father. But the Child heere is God, and is borne of a Woman. <hi>Nestorius</hi> denied it; but the true Church maintaines it; and the Synod to that end, decreed Christs Mother to be styled <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the bearer of God. Indeed Christ tooke but his Man-hood from her Seed. But that Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood being joyned to his God-head, in her wombe personally, we truely beleeve her to have borne God. The Word tooke flesh of her, and God lay in her wombe, and was borne of her body. A grand won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if but thus. But there is more. That woman was a Virgin. A Virgin beare a Childe? Nature abhorres to heare it. Put both words together, the Bearer a Virgin, and the Child God. <hi>Paul</hi> might well call it <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a great mystery, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, full of wonderment and astonishment. <hi>Paul</hi> saies but <hi>factum ex Muliere,</hi> God sent his Sonne made of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; that termes true, but too generall; and the Word might meane a Wife. But <hi>Esay</hi> is more explicate; Behold, a Virgin shall conceive and beare. That indeed required an <hi>Ecce. Jeremie</hi> calles it a new thing, <hi>Foemina circundabit virum,</hi> that a Woman should compasse a Man. Surely this is a thing more new, more strange, a Virgin to compasse a God. A Virgin to beare, <hi>Mirandum;</hi> to beare God, <hi>Stupendum.</hi> At the wonder of the one, the Virgins selfe cryed out, <hi>Quomodo fiet istud?</hi> How was it possible, shee should conceive, not knowing man? But take both at once; they are worthy the wonder even of Angels also. I thinke <hi>Gabriel</hi> that told her it, was amazed at it, yea were it not, that God saith, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. nothing can be wonderfull to him, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the wonderment even of Gods selfe. Very fitly therefore it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes in this verse, the Childs name shall be wonderfull.</p>
            <p>To end this, [Christs Incarnation a Greeke Father cals <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap> the most incredible thing, that ever was.

               </gap>, <hi>Cyril.</hi> Speech
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:173124:14"/> cannot expresse it, wit cannot conceive it. Every sober Christian must (as Saint <hi>Basil</hi> wisheth) <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, rather seriously adore the Doer, then curiously enquire the manner. For as saith the same Father, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the manner is above enquiry, <hi>Luther</hi> was wont to say, God will not have us <hi>Quoerists.</hi> I may better say, God will not have us <hi>Quomodists.</hi> For why God was Incarnate, the Scripture hath reveiled, but how, it hath not. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calles it a Mystery, Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> saies, it is wonderfull. Then must wee not aske how it is; For (as <hi>Athanasius</hi> saies) <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> a mystery reveiled, is no longer wondered at. Thus then the Lord of Glory tooke unto himselfe the shape of a Servant. Man was first made after Gods Image; but now God was made after Mans Image. God said of Man in Ironie, behold, Man is become like one of Vs? But now we may say of God in earnest, behold, God is become like one of us.</p>
            <p>Now Actions all have their Intentions, aime at some end. Heere I may, I must be a Quaerist, aske, Why is this Childe borne? <hi>Esay</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers, <hi>For us,</hi> the last word in my Text. Tis in the Booke, <hi>unto us;</hi> thats all one in the Originall. <hi>Nobis,</hi> but one word, but pregnant, a word with a wombe, It beares a Child too; meanes both <hi>quibus, &amp; ad quid:</hi> both the Persons, who have benefit by this Birth; and what the Benefit is.

To you is borne a Saviour.</hi> The <hi>Nicen</hi> Creed more plainly, For us men, and for our Salvation. First for <hi>ad quid,</hi> but a word, because tis but coucht onely.</p>
            <p>Such a Child, and such a Birth, both of such wonder, must not be for nought. Tis not <hi>parturiunt montes.</hi> The end is as admirable; the Child is borne for our Salvation. The Act, you heard <hi>Chrysostome</hi> call it <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

Tert.</hi> Indeed it was not worthy, the saving of 10000. worlds was too meane a thing for so rich a price, as Gods Sonnes birth. But it pleased him to esteeme one world, halfe of one world, nay not halfe (for to how small a handfull is man compar'd with the Elect onely, the benefit of it with other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures) worthy that price. For then <hi>Natus est,</hi> he was borne, nay, he was more, much more, it follows heere, for them <hi>Datus est,</hi> he was given, <hi>a Son is given to us, i. for us.</hi> Gods Son, <hi>Datus est, i. traditus est,</hi> so the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers conster it, was given to death for us.

Proptereà veni, Iohn</hi> 12. 27. hee came of purpose to that end. <hi>Osiander</hi> was so impudent, as to contradict the Prophet, saith, wee were borne for Christ, Christ was not borne for us.

            </p>
            <p>That men are meant, I neede not often iterate; men only. Yet have the Angels benefit too by Christs birth. They also are by it, though not redeemed, yet confirmed. Not redeemed, because they fell not, the good Angels I meane; but confirmed; <hi>i.</hi> put out of feare of fall. But de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils have no good at all by it: They crie to Christ, <hi>Quid nobis? What have we to doe with thee Iesus, Sonne of God?</hi> To men onely and to all, at least if we meane, <hi>genera singulorum,</hi> if not <hi>singulos generum,</hi> every se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall man, yet some of every sort.</p>
            <p>To all, that is, <hi>ad minimum,</hi> to men of all nations, times and states. For <hi>nobis</hi> doth not distinguish between sexe or age. For the first, <hi>Is God</hi> (saith <hi>Paul) God of the Iewes onely, and not also of the Gentiles? Iob</hi> though an <hi>Edomite</hi> calls Christ his Redeemer. Christ was borne in <hi>Bethleem,</hi> a towne of the Iewes, but bred and brought up in <hi>Galilee</hi> of the Gentiles, and his title on the Crosse had as well <hi>Iesus of Nazareth,</hi> as <hi>King of the Iewes;</hi> not onely Israels glory, in old <hi>Simeons</hi> song, but the light too of the Gentiles. For times, the ancient <hi>Patriarks,</hi> both before the floud and after it, Prophets and other holy men under the law, many beleevers in Christs dayes, and Saints <hi>sans nombre</hi> in all ages since, are within this little word, the child is borne for them. For estates, whats thy profession, or thy place, office, trade, occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation? Art thou Priest, or Prophet, Captaine, or Counsellour, Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licane, Physitian, Tent-maker, Purple-seller, Fisherman, Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, what neede I reckon moe? The Gospell hath example of some saved of all these. Art thou a meere begger, or a man of wealth? Poore <hi>Lazarus</hi> was laid in the bosome of rich <hi>Abraham. Bond and free, male and femall are all one</hi> (S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith) <hi>in Christ Iesus.</hi> For he was borne in mans sexe, but made of womans seede: and of two bond servants grin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding at the mill, the one shall be received. The young and aged alike too. <hi>Iohn</hi> sprong for joy in his mothers wombe, at the presence of his Saviour in the Virgins wombe: and old <hi>Simeons</hi> armes embraced Gods salvation. Lastly, <hi>Anna</hi> a widdow, and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> a wife acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged Christ their Lord, and <hi>Mary</hi> a Virgine calls her Sonne her Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</p>
            <p>To conclude, all grant this <hi>Nobis,</hi> Christ was borne for us: but some say, <hi>sibi</hi> too, he was borne too for himselfe. <hi>Nemo sibi nascitur; Plato</hi> saith, no man is borne for himselfe. Surely Christ was not. Some Schoolemen say, he was; <hi>Christus sibi meruit,</hi> they all hold. But <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> saith, <hi>Non sibi,</hi> 9. 26. It will little edifie to argue it; I end. This child, this holy child, borne (as on this day) to us, the child Iesus interceede for us unto his Father, and by his holy Spirit seale unto our soules his grant of our salvation.

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Preachers theme on this day should be of Christs birth: and Christ hath purged our sinnes by his death, not by his birth. My Text then sorts not with the time. But I have here spok be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, often of Christs Nativitie. And why was Christ incarnate, but to fit himselfe to suffer, and so to purge our sinnes. And have we not this morning, though it be Christmas day, celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Sacrament of our Saviours death? And is not this Scripture a part of the Epistle appointed for this day? Yea and the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> in the first morning lesson, hath he not conjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Christs birth and death together? <hi>Puer natus est nobis, filius datus est nobis,</hi> a child is borne for us, a sonne is given for us; <hi>Datus, i. Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> as the Fathers conster it, given to death for us, so to purge our sins? This Theme and Scripture then is seasonable enough; consisting of foure termes; an Act, <hi>Purging,</hi> the Object, <hi>Sinne,</hi> the Subject, <hi>Ours,</hi> the Instrument, <hi>Himselfe. Hath by himselfe purged our sinnes.</hi> The person is not mentioned; that Point would be extravagant; pertinent enough unto the purpose; but my Text shall confine me. Of the foure forenamed Points, God assisting, with your patience, severally and briefely. Christmas dayes afternoone is not the best time for long attention.</p>
            <p>First for the Act, tis purging, a necessary act. For sinne (saith Saint <hi>Augustine) aut sanabitur, aut damnabitur,</hi> must be if not purged, then damned. The terme whether a Physicke Metaphor, so made by some; or alluding to the law of purging sinne by sacrifice, which rather seemes; I shall pray leave to take it either way promiscuously. Sinne is

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the expiation of that sinne. It <hi>Purgamentum,</hi> hee <hi>Piamentum.</hi> The Passion of the Sonne of God, the purgation of the sinne of man. For what is purgation, but an expiation <hi>i.</hi> a propitiation, an appeasing of Gods wrath on a sinner by sacrifice? Who knowes <hi>Pauls</hi> meaning better than himselfe? That which here is called a purging, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 20. is called a pacifying. (He did therefore <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, offer up himselfe, that he might <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, take away our sinne, <hi>Heb. 9. ult.</hi>) I say, the end of Christs passion was to purge sinne, called therefore by Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> the sacrifice of our purgation. Christ is dead, God is pleased, and sinne is pardoned.</p>
            <p>But the terme hath yet more in it, to purge is to purifie, as well as to pacifie; to pacifie God, and to purifie sinne in man. There is more in purging, than to pardon Sinne (saith Saint <hi>Ambrose, Tegitur per chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem, deletur per sanguinem,</hi> it is covered by the Fathers love, but quite done out by the Sonnes bloud. Hee did therefore <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, offer up his Sonne, that hee might <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, doe away our sinnes, <hi>Heb. 9. ult.</hi> Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> Epistle calls it <hi>cleansing,</hi> his Revelation <hi>washing;</hi> Christ hath purged, <hi>i.</hi> hath purified, hath washed, and cleansed our sinnes with his bloud. Bloud should seeme rather to pollute, than purge; to defile, than to make cleane. A thing bespraid with bloud, rather needs purging, than is purged by it. But that is the prerogative of Christs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious bloud; because (as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> speakes of it in the 20. of the <hi>Acts</hi>) it is Gods owne bloud.</p>
            <p>Hee hath purged our sinnes, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> as Saint <hi>Iames</hi> termeth it, wickednesse is filthinesse. The vulgar Latine shunning the eares of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, hath a more civill terme, <hi>Immundities,</hi> uncleanenesse. But a man may be too manerly in this. No terme too odious to bestow on sinne: Even in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> which is called the holy tongue, and by Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, sinne is not spar'd. Sinne in the civilest phrase is yet unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and impuritie. For so it pleaseth these daintie-eared dayes, though they act positive sinnes, yet to crave privative termes; fine in naming them, though grosse in doing them. Be sinne no more then so; yet needs it purging. For God endures not, heaven receives not any uncleane, any impure thing. Out of Christs side came water and bloud. Sinne is uncleanenesse; that water washed it: it is impuritie; that bloud hath purged it. Christ is the right Physitian, <hi>Epiphanius</hi> calls him so. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver could Physitian, never would Physitian offer to cure sinne; it is the soules sicknesse. But <hi>medico omnipotenti nihil insanabile, Aug.</hi> Christs bloud is the right woundwort, that soveraine <hi>Panacea,</hi> which heales all diseases. God heales (saith <hi>David</hi>) all thine infirmities; not heales them, that is covers them; but he cures them, he removes them. <hi>Tollit</hi> (saith <hi>Iohn the Baptist</hi>) he takes sinne quite away.</p>
            <p>Sinne is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a Poison; Christs bloud <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a Conterpoison. The poison (saith Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi>) which the Serpent shot into the heeles of all <hi>Eves</hi> sonnes, is drawne out by a plaister spread of Christs bloud. Physitians write of <hi>palma Christi,</hi> that it purgeth the body infected with a feaver. But here is <hi>sanguis Christi</hi> purgeth the soule, being sicke of sin. It is the <hi>Hysope,</hi> which <hi>David</hi> in the <hi>Psalme</hi> prayed to be purged with,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:173124:16"/> and then he should be cleane: Cleane, not <hi>in superficie;</hi> hee saith not only, wash me, and I shall be white; but purge mee with Hyssope, and I shall be cleane; not <hi>in cute,</hi> faire of skinne, but <hi>in corde,</hi> cleare of sinne. Purging pierceth deeper than bare washing: and yet in the 5. <hi>verse</hi> of the <hi>Apoca.</hi> Christ is but said to wash. But purging by Christ, and wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is all one. For the water of his side was <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> a piercer and searcher even into the soule; and so a purger too, as well as his bloud; even a purger of sinne. [Indeed, some say, sinne is not purged but pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, onely topt, the stumpe abides, or at least but shaven, the rootes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine; <hi>Peccatum rasum,</hi> a peeld conceit of shavelings. Christs washing was not superficiall. Hee did <hi>Eluere, Eruere;</hi> not lightly wet it, but wash it out; not slightly cut it, but grubbe it up.] Enough of the Act; now to the Object.</p>
            <p>Sinne, a right peccant humour, as Physitians speake: It is it, that Christ hath purged. The devill is a purger. Hee purged <hi>Eve</hi> and <hi>Adam,</hi> but it was of grace. Hee desires to purge us too; but it is of faith, and of the feare of God. There are outlandish purgers too, from <hi>Rhemes</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> (for some like Physicke from <hi>Italian</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Doctors, rather than from <hi>English</hi>) purgers of Heresie in pretence, but indeed of Truth. Grace, Faith, Gods feare and truth, need no purgation: that Physicke is for things impure. Sinne is corrupt, polluted, and uncleane: it needs the purging; and Christ hath purged it.</p>
            <p>Sin both originall and actuall, both which wee draw from <hi>Adam,</hi> and which we doe our selves, Christs bloud hath purged. <hi>All sinne,</hi> for so it is, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 7. that place a glosse to this.</p>
            <p>All sinne? Will some man say: Concupiscence is sinne; hath Christ purged that? Is it not in us still? In all of us? Till death? Or shall wee with the Papists denie it to be sinne? It is sinne; and Christ hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged it; but as Physitians use to purge bad humours. They rid not the whole humour quite out of the bodie: that were to kill the bodie not to cure it. The humours are our Radicals, the materialls of mans bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die. But they purge out their excesse, and their malignitie. So hath Christ purged concupiscence, not <hi>ut non sit,</hi> but <hi>it non <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>bsit,</hi> not from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in us, but from hurting us. The malice of it hee hath purged. His bloud once purged, and his Spirit still checketh the enormitie of lust, but the infirmitie remaines. The might and spight of it he hath remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: the might, that it shall not <hi>regnare;</hi> the spight, that it shall not <hi>damnare.</hi> But the site of it he hath not stird: it still dwels in our flesh, <hi>ad agonem, Aug.</hi> for our exercise.</p>
            <p>I am naturally inclind to some disease; even from the wombe; it was in my conception. Physicke may ease the effects of it; but it can not roote out the originals. The actuall operation it may ease; but it can not cure the originall inclination. For the disposition is in my composition, Man is borne with concupiscence, begot with it. I would not say, Christ could not; (there the comparison failes betweene Christ and the Physitian; he can doe all things) but he did not purge out the prone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the flesh to sinne, lusts inclination. He could; for hee will at the resurrection free us quite from the infirmitie. But hee would not in this life. His bloud but purged the malice of concupiscence. The guilt and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:173124:16"/> paine of it, desert of death and condemnation, both these are done away. But it is active still: the activitie is but purged in part; the power abated onely, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Epiph.</hi> Christ hath but curbed concupiscence: he hath fettered her, but not slaughtered her. For all the purging, she workes still in us; but more weakely.</p>
            <p>Papists here take advantage. They say, <hi>Paul</hi> saith no more, then Christ hath purged our sinnes. That is nothing to the paine. But sinne, staine, and paine are <hi>comites individui;</hi> Christ hath purged both, or nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: [<hi>Hippocrates</hi> twines, borne together, dead together] in the 18. of Saint <hi>Mathew,</hi> saith not Christ, <hi>Omne debitum,</hi> the whole debt is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged? Either then the paine is no debt, or it is pardoned. Say Papist, is it debt or no? If it be not; then it is to be paied. If it be; then it is pardoned. And if pardoned by the Father; then purged by the Sonne. For the one pardons not, what the other purges not; and so much onely for the second point.</p>
            <p>Two termes are yet behind, the subject and the instrument. Christ purged sinne: but whose? and how? Whose sinnes? and by what sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice? The <hi>Remists</hi> text might ease me of this labour: for it hath nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. First, Whose? Our sinnes, be it spoken to our shame; but it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to our comfort. Man made in Gods owne Image, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

He whom the Poet termes <hi>Magnum Iovis incrementum,</hi> the divine seede of God, soile himselfe with sinne, <hi>Sathanae excremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> even very devils dung? Yet man so grac'd, so blest, he ownes these sinnes, Our sinnes. The more our shame.</p>
            <p>Now for our comfort; Sinne, it hath seased as well on Angels, as on man. The devill, and all the cursed feends in hell, were once bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Angels in heaven, stood before the Trinitie, and beheld the face of God. But when Lucifer in his pride, envying Gods glory, said in his heart, I will ascend up into heaven, and advance my throne above the starres; I will sit on the sides of the North, and be equall to the most highest. Then the Lord cast him downe from heaven unto hell, from the sides of the North, unto the sides of the pit. And all the rest of that rebellious Rout, partners of his conspiracie, God threw them also downe into the place of darkenesse, where they are reserved in everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting chaines unto the judgement of the great Day. Man for his sinne was throwne out of Paradise, the creatures for his sake accurst, and himselfe sentenced to death and hell. Christ pitied man, but not the Angels. Their case alike for sinne, but not for grace. Their damnation
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:173124:17"/> is eternall. <hi>Origen</hi> hath some hope of them, themselves have none. For the fire is everlasting, <hi>which</hi> Christ saies <hi>is prepared for the devill and his angels.</hi> But a Redeemer was ordained for Man. Gods Sonne would be Incarnate, to recover <hi>him.</hi> His sinnes had wrought Gods wrath: and Christ by his Bloud vouchsaft to purge those sinnes, not the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, but <hi>our</hi> sinnes.</p>
            <p>What if one should say to Christ, (tis Christs owne supposition) <hi>Medice, cura teipsum, Physitian heale thy Selfe?</hi> He purgd our sinnes: why purgd he not his owne? <hi>Aaron</hi> purgd sinnes; but his owne, as well as others: For he was a sinner, like to them; and therefore his sinne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offerings were not for others onely, but also for himselfe. But Christ knew no sinne: Himselfe needed no sacrifice. <hi>Gabriel</hi> told <hi>Daniel Messias should be slaine, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, but not for himselfe.</hi> Christ hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <hi>our</hi> sinnes not his owne, he needed not; not the Angels, it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him not.

               </gap>, the Reconciliation, he is the Propitiation for <hi>our</hi> sinnes.</p>
            <p>To end this; Christ might have saved the Angels, and not us; pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <hi>their</hi> sinnes, and not <hi>ours.</hi> But it pleased him to purge <hi>ours.</hi> The more his Mercy. The Angels his Souldiers, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. The Persians had a Band, termed the Immortall Band, <hi>Socrates.</hi> Angels are so indeed, Gods immortall Band. His Souldiers: His Sonnes. Scripture calles often, Angels the Sonnes of God. Gods Sonnes? Gods Selfe. Are they not called <hi>Elohim,</hi> that is, Gods? Powers, Thrones, Dominions, Principalities, their Orders. We the Sonnes of <hi>Adam;</hi> whose Father is Corruption, and the Wormes our sisters and kinswo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; <hi>Iob</hi> 17. 14. Wormes our sisters? Wormes our selves.

This is nothing: all this makes us but <hi>vile.</hi> But (which may make us <hi>odius</hi> to God) his Enemies. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 10.

            <p>Yet rests the Instrument, wherewith Christ hath wrought this Act <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> upon this Object. <hi>Per Semetipsum;</hi> tis <hi>Himselfe.</hi> The Actour, and the Instrument are not lightly one; heere they are, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, <hi>Epiph.</hi> both Priest and Sacrifice: or (as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> speakes to the Physicke Metaphor) <hi>Ipse medicus, ipse medicina,</hi> both Physitian and Physicke too. The Preists of <hi>Aarons</hi> order purged sinne. They wrought the same Act, but by other Instrument. By Bloud, like Christ; but by the bloud of Beasts. <hi>Hostia</hi> was <hi>Bestia,</hi> Beasts were Sinne-offrings. But Christ is the purger, and purgation both; both Sacrifice and Priest. <hi>David</hi> saies in the <hi>Psalmes,</hi> that <hi>a Horse is accounted but a vaine thing to save a man.</hi> What then is a Goate, a Bullocke, or a Lambe? Surely all as vaine as it: but that God had appointed them to be the types of Christ. All Beasts are peeres, in that respect; all unable to purge sin; the greatest as the least: but that God was pleased to accept of his owne Ordinance, untill the body came, whose shadowes they were. When that Body came; he became the sacrifice; and Christ <hi>per Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metipsum,</hi> purged our sinnes by <hi>Himselfe.</hi> Silver would not serve, nor
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:173124:17"/> Gold for our purgation; which serve sometimes with Men. A World of Treasure is not worth a Soule. Angels would not serve, the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest of the Creatures. The purge of sinne transcends the power of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels: Gods Bloud must purge mans sinne, but in mans nature. Christ therefore to this Act would use no other Instrument, but his owne bloud. <hi>Himselfe</hi> hath purged our sinnes, <hi>by Himselfe.</hi> Why then it seemes, that purgatory is but an imposture, Indeed a purger; but of purses, not of sinnes. One of the Popes mainest meanes, mainest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanes; sinne to be purged after death, let heathens hold it, who first devised it. Tis a conceipt, becomes not Christians: whose sole pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation is Christs selfe, <hi>That</hi> after death, is prophane Paganisme. Then is the time <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, of paine, not of purgation, saith <hi>Gregory Naz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another plea there is, in the case of indulgences, the Popes prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, a very speciall plea. It is Christs Vicarship. Doth Christ purge sinnes? Why then the Pope does too: he is his Vicar. Surely he is, as other Bishops are Which of them is not Christs Vicar? Substitutes to Christ, and his deputies Ministers for many Ghostly offices. But in this businesse he deputeth none. God the Father hath delegated him; he hath subdelegated none. Should his Vicar doe that, which himselfe hath done in person? For so is the phrase in the Communion booke, that Christ purged sinne in his owne Person. The Ministers in many things are his Commissioners, in the Word in the Sacraments, in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination. But the purging of sinnes, that worke he performed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonally. To <hi>bind</hi> and <hi>loose</hi> sinne, that the Priest may doe; but not to purge it. He might in the Law, but he may not in the Gospell. Christs Bloud was the onely sacrifice for sinne: and that he offered up <hi>Himselfe</hi> for it, himselfe alone. Others shed it, but for other purpose; not to offer it to God for Sinne. The Priests, and People, the Iudge, and executioners, whosoever had a hand, any hand in Christs Passion, they all were shedders of his Bloud, <hi>Iudas</hi> and all, sathan and all. But the offering of it up for a ransome for mans sinne; nay not <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> onely, to be a Ransome, but to speake to the Physicke sense, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, for a Lotion, to wash our Soule: a Lotion? nay a potion, a purgative poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to purge our sinne; that was Christs Act, his <hi>Personall</hi> Act.</p>
            <p>The Romane Catholicke sacrificing Priest saies, he does it too, at every Masse, at every Eucharist, he offers up Christs bloud and body for our sinnes. But it is but <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, saith Saint <hi>Chysostome,</hi> a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, not a Sacrifice. An Act, that could be done, but once: and it Christ did in his owne person. <hi>Paul</hi> saies it often, and Saint <hi>Peter</hi> too, that Christ suffered not, Christ offered not himselfe more then once; and by his Bloud shed but that once, purged sinne for ever.</p>
            <p>Yet lest the Papist thinke me too refract, I will not deny utterly all power of purging to the Sacraments. Surely they purge, both Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme and Eucharist. Our Liturgie confesseth it. But the purge is my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall; it is the bookes terme: because the Elements in them both are the mysteries of Christs Death. Yea and Repentance too, is said to purge sinne, said in Scripture: but meerely meant, as it hath Reference unto Christs bloud. No man receives either Sacrament, or repents a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:173124:18"/> but Faith, like the bunch of Hysope in the Passeover, dips it selfe in Christs bloud, and besprinkles the Soule with it; and so pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges sinne.</p>
            <p>To conclude, as God saies of saving, so Christ may say of purging, <hi>Non est preter me,</hi> there is no purgation of sinne, but Christs Bloud. Of this Act, he is sole Agent, sole Instrument. He had <hi>Simon</hi> of <hi>Cyrene</hi> to helpe him beare the Crosse; but he had not any to helpe him purge our sinnes. He bore the Crosse partly by another: but hee bore our sinnes wholly by himselfe. And therefore solely unto him, and to his Father, and the Holy Ghost, be worthily rendred all glory and thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, <hi>Nunc, &amp; in secula.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This point hath yet one Adversary more; but he was not in his wits. One <hi>Barnardine O chinus:</hi> Who because <hi>Paul</hi> saith in the 20. of the <hi>Acts</hi> that <hi>God hath purchased the Church with his bloud,</hi> would have therefore God the Father, the Purger of our sinnes, as if his bloud were shed. And <hi>Petrus Gnapheus</hi> a madder man then he, who would joyne all the Persons compurgatours with Christ. For he held all three were cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. God the Father of Heaven, who as on this Day sent his Sonne to purge our sinnes, by his holy Spirit assure our Soules of our purgation.

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE fittest argument for Christmas day is Christs Nativitie; but I have already twise preached of that Theame. I will therefore now intreate by Gods assistance, &amp;c. Not of his carnall propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is from man, but of his eternall ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, which was from God. The aime of the whole Chapter is the excellencie of Christ, compared with the Angels, but preferred farre before them for many high prerogatives. I have made choise of one, the fittest for this Festivall, the honourable and incomparable title of Gods Sonne, not communicated by God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any of his creatures. For unto which of the Angels said he at any time, <hi>Thou art my Sonne this day have I begotten thee.</hi> A Text of Gods owne testimony, of Christs neerenesse unto God; not his servant, as was <hi>David, Psal. 89. Iuravi David servo meo.</hi> Not his friend, as was <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Iames</hi> 2. 23. hee was called the friend of God, but his Sonne, <hi>Thou art my Sonne.</hi> His <hi>Sonne,</hi> not by creation, as was <hi>Adam, Luke 3. ult. Adam, who was the Sonne of God;</hi> Not by adoption, as are the Saints, <hi>Rom. 8. 16. Filij dei sumus,</hi> we are the sonnes of God: but by generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>This day have I begotten thee.</hi> [Hee said it not to men, though they be deare unto him; nay he said it not to Angels, though they be neere unto him. <hi>For to which of the Angels said God at any time, thou art my Sonne, this day have I begotten thee.</hi>]</p>
            <pb n="26" facs="tcp:173124:19"/>
            <p>The Text consisteth of three distinct members; the generall matter of them all is the attribute of Gods Sonne. The first removes it from the Angels [<hi>To which of the Angels said hee at any time.</hi>] The next conferres it upon Christ, [<hi>Thou art my Sonne</hi>] The third is added, either <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> for demonstration; no proofe so pregnant for the sonnes assurance of his sire, as that hee hath begotten him. <hi>This day have I begotten thee.</hi> These are the generall heads of this Scripture, I will speake of them, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>For the first; No Angell? at no time? Surely it should seeme that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> is too peremptory. The Angell in the furnace. <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. 25. Is not hee called the Sonne of God? Then there is one. They in the first of <hi>Iob ver.</hi> 6. that are called the Sonnes of God, were they not Angells? All Expositors say they were. There then are many called so. Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you will say, that the Angell in <hi>Daniel,</hi> is not called the sonne of God, but onely said to be like the Sonne of God; and <hi>nullum simile est idem.</hi> So may I say of Christ, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 14. he is called not <hi>unigenitus,</hi> but <hi>quasi unigenitus,</hi> not the only Sonne of God, but as the onely Sonne of God, and yet he is indeed, and God saith it in my text, that hee is the Son of God. Comparative termes, both in the Greek and Hebrew Scriptures are not alwayes <hi>Similitudinis,</hi> but sometimes <hi>Certitudinis;</hi> and it is no question, but a point confest by all, that Angels in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are called the sonnes of God.</p>
            <p>How then? Is our Apostle, as the <hi>Athenians</hi> termed him, a <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, an Idle speaker? Saint <hi>Paul, qui soloecismos facit in loquendo, Hier.</hi> he that in his Grammar, and his Greeke, hath many incongruities; shall I say that he doth soloecise also in Divinitie, in denying the Angells to be called the sonnes of God, when the Scriptures say, they are? Surely the Angels are enstiled Gods sonnes; though sometimes Saint <hi>Chrys.</hi> said they are not (See <hi>Sist. Sen. lib. 5. p. 353. annot.</hi> 72.) so are they called, and so they are; but not in that acception, that Christ is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Gods sonne. There are many sorts of sonnes. The aged person calls the young his sonne; so did old <hi>Eli,</hi> young <hi>Samuel.</hi> The master calls his disciples his sonne; <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

The Preacher is the spirituall Father of his people; the name of sonnes doth not disparage them, for the King himselfe did call the Prophet so, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 6. And Kings are called the fathers of their countrie; their subjects are their sonnes. There is a sonne in law, the husband of my daughter: and there are sonnes by marriage, the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of my wife; beside sundry other sorts, which I cannot stand to cite, by Creation, by Generation, by Adoption, by Affection. Sonnes may be all these wayes. And by diverse of these wayes the Angels may be justly called the sonnes of God: Either as his creatures, hee is their maker, or as his servants, he is their Lord; or as his subjects, hee is their King, or <hi>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

But a sonne in that sense, in which Christ is called
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:173124:19"/> Gods Sonne, God never gave that title to any of the Angels. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith not, that the Angels are not any way Gods Sonnes; but asketh, <hi>Vnto which of them God said at any time, Thou art my Sonne, this day have I begotten thee?</hi> He onely denies them to be Gods begotten Sonnes. Christ in this acception is sonne to God: God hath no more but him; either before him, for he is <hi>Alpha,</hi> or after him, for he is <hi>Omega.</hi> We confesse it in our Creed, <hi>his onely Sonne our Lord.</hi> And the Scriptures expresse it often in that terme, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, his onely begotten Sonne.</p>
            <p>His onely begotten Sonne? Doth not our Apostle in the very next verse call him <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Gods first begotten Sonne? Can <hi>Vnigenitus,</hi> and <hi>primogenitus</hi> be competible to one? <hi>Si solus, qui primus: si pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, qui solus?</hi> If Christ be the first, then are there some besides, and if there be some more, then is not he the sole. A scruple of such force, that it put <hi>Epiphanius</hi> to a hard shift, on the first of <hi>Matthew, ver. ult.</hi> to say, Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> said not, <hi>filium primogenitum suum,</hi> but <hi>filium suum primogenitum;</hi> referring <hi>filium</hi> unto <hi>Mary,</hi> and <hi>primogenitum</hi> unto God. I call it a hard shift. For while he would not grant <hi>Mary</hi> had more sonnes, to save her Virginity, he maketh unwarily God to have more sonnes, a greater absurdity. For the advantage of the word apprehended by some heretickes to proove plurality of sonnes, is as pleadable against God, as against the Virgin. But though in common speech a first is lightly relative to a second: yet in the use of Scripture it is often otherwise; the first doth not imply other to come after, but it doth deny that any went before. And so is the terme to be taken in that place, and also in this Chapter. Christ is there <hi>Maries</hi> first begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten sonne, because she had none before him; and here he is also Gods first begotten Sonne, because hee had none before him. <hi>Vnigenitus &amp; primogenitus are</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in Scripture, they are of one signification. Gods first begotten Sonne, is the very same with his onely begotten Sonne.</p>
            <p>Yet is not this enough. For is not Christ called <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. the first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten among many brethren? Loe there Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith plainly, that God hath more sonnes beside our Saviour; and Christ is therefore called <hi>primogenitus,</hi> because he hath more brethren. That Scripture hath many, and much different expositions; I will rest in this one, that Christ in his flesh is the first borne of them, whom God hath adopted through him to be his sonnes. Not that the adoption belonged not to them, that lived before Christs birth; but that as in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> he is called the Lambe slaine, so I may also say, he was a sonne borne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the beginning of the world. As his condemnation, so likewise his incarnation was from everlasting in Gods decree. Iustly might he so be called Gods first begotten sonne among many brethren. That <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogenitus</hi> of his manhood, is no prejudice to this <hi>Vnigenitus</hi> of his Godhead.</p>
            <p>There is yet one scruple more: Saith not the <hi>Psalmist</hi> that man is little lower then the Angels? Men often in the Gospell are cald the Sonnes of God, not in a large acception, as the Angels were, but (as it should seeme) in the same sense with Christ, and so, when the <hi>Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist</hi> calles lower then the Angels, I might say, that indeed they are
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:173124:20"/> higher then the Angels. The Angels are Gods Sonnes, but not like Christ, not his sonnes by generation. But it is said of men, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. Wee are his generation. It was a Poets speech, but Saint <hi>Paul</hi> hath made it Scripture, and how often doth Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> both in his Gospell, and in his first Epistle affirme of the faithfull, that they are borne of God. Borne, you will say, but not begot of God; for that terme is in my Text, <hi>This day have I begotten thee.</hi> But there being no distinction of sexe in the Deity, it is all one with God, to beare, and to beget. And yet let me tell you this withall, that though in your bookes, in your English Translations, and in the Latine too, you read it, (<hi>borne of God</hi>) yet in the Originall, it is, (<hi>begot of God.</hi>) And if all this will not serve, looke 1 <hi>Iohn.</hi> 5. 18. there shall you find the very terme in my Text, the righteous man said to be begot of God.</p>
            <p>Now to remoove this scruple; first for the Poets speech, it is not to this purpose, that we are Gods generation, that is, his sonnes by ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration; but is meant of our soules, that they come immediately from the Lord. They are not like our bodies, either made of earth, as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi> was, or bred of man, as all ours are; but they are the immediate workemanship of God, and (as the Latine Poet said) <hi>Divinae particula aurae,</hi> breathed into our bodies by the Spirit of God. They are Gods generation; but (as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith) <hi>non natura, sed munere,</hi> not of his begetting, but of his bestowing: the generation is onely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration, the breath of man is from the breath of God.</p>
            <p>And for those termes of the Evangelists, borne and begot of God, which seeme more neerely to touch Christs title, they are not meant <hi>univoce;</hi> our birth and begetting is not like that of Christs; his from the substance of his Father, ours from the Spirit of his Father: the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration is but his operation. Gods seed is in us, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 9. another pregnant place to proove us Sonnes, Sonnes like to Christ. But that seed is not Gods substance, but his word. The Holy Ghost is the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, out of the wombe of the Church, by the seed of the Gospell, he begetteth us unto God, and by the midwifry of his Ministers bringeth us forth his Sonnes, not by generation, but by regeneration. So that we are his Sonnes, not <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>
               <hi>facti,</hi> not by begetting us, but by adopting us. The Sonneship is termed <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 5. but <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, as <hi>Peter Lumb.</hi> termeth it, <hi>factura, non natura,</hi> not by nature, but by grace, and therefore is no prejudice to Christs prerogative.</p>
            <p>To conclude this first point; very honourable attributes are given to the Angels often in the Scriptures. They are in such place and grace with their Creatour, that he hath imparted his owne title unto them, and called them Gods. But Christs prerogative to be his Sonne, Christ hath reserved that title to himselfe. The Angels are Gods <hi>Nuntioes,</hi> their name betokens it; and you may proportion that honour by the Popes. They are Gods Servants, <hi>Psalme 103. ult,</hi> they are Gods Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 15. his Servants and his Souldiers, but not his Sonnes. Christs meere peculiar, to be his Sonne, to be Gods begotten Sonne, <hi>gloriam meam,</hi> faith the Prophet, let me turne it, <hi>gloriam <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>am non dabo alteri;</hi> he will not give that glory unto any. Not to any Creature; no not to any Angell hath God said at any time, but onely unto Christ,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:173124:20"/>
               <hi>Thou art my Sonne;</hi> and that is the next point in my Text.</p>
            <p>The second member hath three termes, one of the Relation, it is a <hi>Sonne,</hi> and secondly of the Correlatives, under the pronominall notes, <hi>meus,</hi> and <hi>tu; Thou, i.</hi> Christ, <hi>Mine, i.</hi> Gods. For the first, will Christ robbe his Father? These words are said to <hi>David</hi> in the second <hi>Psalme</hi> Christ was the sonne of <hi>David:</hi> will Christ bereave his Father of his right, and a title appropriated by God unto his Sire, will the sonne im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate it unto himselfe? But Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in his Sermon <hi>ad populum Antiochenum, Acts</hi> 13. sheweth that this text is meant of the <hi>Messias;</hi> in type pretended unto <hi>David,</hi> but in truth intended unto Christ. For the words in the Originall are <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and it is the observation of an Hebrew <hi>Rabbin,</hi> that <hi>Attah</hi> is one of the names of God; but a personall name, not common to the Trinity, but proper unto Christ; for it signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth (saith he) <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the wisedome of God; and the Apostle telleth us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 24. that Christ is Gods wisedome.</p>
            <p>The person then is Christ; but what Christ? for there is <hi>Christus ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. the man Christ, and there is <hi>Christus Dominus, Luke 2. 11. The Lord Christ.</hi> Both indeed are but one Christ. But we must di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish betweene the natures. All this that hath beene said in the first point, is meant of Christ not as man, but as God. For as he was man, he had no father. Wee have fathers of our flesh, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 9. but Christ had none. The Apostle saith it plainely, <hi>Cap. 7. ver.</hi> 3. he was <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>i.</hi> without a father. And it is but a harsh speech, which Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> hath, <hi>Ipse homo, ex quo esse coepit, filius Dei unicus esse coepit,</hi> that Christs humanitie so soone as it had being, was presently Gods Son. Whence <hi>Servetus</hi> the Spaniard tooke the hint of his heresie, that Christ but then began to be Gods Sonne when he tooke flesh. I know the Angell said unto the Virgin, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 35, that the holy thing which she should beare, should be called the Sonne of God. But what did shee beare? not <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

            <p>The next terme in this member is the other correlative, <hi>Thou art my Son.</hi> A Pagan fathers it upon <hi>Salomon,</hi> that God hath no son. <hi>Aug. Ep. 49. quest▪</hi> 5. Christ was the Son, God is the Father; a Father fit for such a Sonne; for who should father God, but God. I will not aske, which
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:173124:21"/> God, because there is but one. But yet there are three persons of that one God. The second is not hee; for so he should be sonne unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, as <hi>Hermes</hi> called him <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>. The third is not hee, for the holy Ghost proceeds from him. But God the first person, and the fountaine of the Deitie, Christ is his sonne. We are Gods sonnes; but not the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers onely; all the persons in the Trinity have their right in that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood. But the first person onely is father unto Christ. Hee may say unto us also, that wee are his sonnes; but the holy Ghost and the Word may say it as well as hee. But unto Christ neither third, nor se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond person, but the first alone can say, <hi>thou art my Sonne.</hi> I say the whole fraternitie of Gods Elect are sonnes to God. Yea the whole so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie of all mankind are sonnes to him. Nay, the universitie of all the creatures doe call him Father. <hi>Vnus pater omnium,</hi> there is one father of all, <hi>Eph. 4. 6. i.</hi> of all the faithfull. <hi>Thou art our Father, and wee thy handie worke, Esay</hi> 68. 8. it is meant of all mankind, and <hi>Iob 38. 28 He is the Father of the raine,</hi> and the dew droppes are his sonnes. Yea that which is more, the terme in my text appropriated to Christ, is there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienated to them, they are his begotten sonnes. But this Paternitie is a communitie; the Godhead hath three persons, and it is liable alike unto them all. But the first alone hath proprietie in Christ, and none but he can say; <hi>Thou art my Sonne.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> hath it expresly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 22. hee calls him <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

            <p>But saith not the Scripture, that Christ was <hi>Davids</hi> sonne?

            <p>The last terme in this member, is the Title of relation, <hi>Thou art my Sonne,</hi> Christ is Gods Sonne. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians, 1. 3. ult.</hi> telleth us in generall that Christ is Gods. But what is he of Gods? To be Gods servant, to be Gods friend are two glorious references, thought worthy of the two grand Worthies of the world, <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Abraham.</hi> But this relation is farre more honourable, to be Gods Sonne.

But to be the Sonne of God, is a title so peculiar to our Saviour in this sense, that not onely no creature, either man or Angell, but not the Holy Ghost himselfe may claime it; he is the spirit of God, but not the Sonne of God. The truth of it testified by a cloud of witnesses, God spake once and twise, as <hi>David</hi> saith, both at Christs baptisme, and when he was transfigured, <hi>This is my beloved Sonne.</hi> Christ often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth it, and calles him <hi>Abba Father.

            <p>The third member of my Text is the explication of the second. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause among men there are sundry sorts of Sonnes; yea all creatures are called Gods Sonnes in some acception; as Christ is there gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally said to be his Sonne, so here it is more specially expounded in what sense. <hi>This day have I begotten thee.</hi> Christ is Gods begotten Son. <hi>Arius</hi> granted him to be his Sonne, but by Creation; and all his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers granted him his sonne, but by adoption. But Saint <hi>Hilary</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puteth it against the heretickes, and prooveth Christ Gods Sonne, <hi>ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, non adoptione, nativitate, non creatione;</hi> not created, but begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, not adopted, but his sonne borne.</p>
            <p>For the former, <hi>Arius</hi> stumbling at the <hi>Greeke</hi> Text, <hi>Proverbes</hi> 8. 22. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the Lord created me, on that corrupt translation grounded his heresie, that Christ was a Creature. But the <hi>Hebrew</hi> is not so; and though it were, yet the Fathers doe avoid that absurdity many waies; I cannot stand to cite them. And had hee lookt a little lower, <hi>ver.</hi> 25. he might have found there the very terme in my Text, <hi>before the hilles, was I begotten.</hi> Christ was Gods Sonne, saith <hi>Arius,</hi> but <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, not borne so, but made so. But we learne by the Evangelist, that all things that were made, were made by Christ. Who then made him? He cannot say, his Father; for then hee made not all. But the Evangelist doubles it, <hi>that without him was made nothing, that was made;</hi> and I hope he will not say, he made himselfe. And therefore <hi>Peter Lomb.</hi> determines against <hi>Arius,</hi> that Christ was Gods Sonne, <hi>non factura,</hi> but <hi>natura,</hi> not by being made, but by being borne. Yea many ages before him, <hi>Athanasius</hi> in his <hi>Creed</hi> had said the same, <hi>begotten, not made.</hi> He was made the Sonne of Man, but he was borne the Sonne of God.</p>
            <p>For the other, Christ (saith <hi>S. Hilary</hi>) is the Sonne of God, <hi>Verita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, non nuncupatione,</hi> not in title but in truth.

            <p>By begetting him? then Saint <hi>Basils</hi> rule belike is false, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to beget, in God, is not meant of essence, but of subsistence, not of nature, but of person. The Godhead of the Word, as he is God is of himselfe, but the person of the Sonne is of the Father.</p>
            <p>Hence naturally ariseth a controversed point betweene <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Calvine,</hi> whether Christ be <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, God of himselfe. <hi>Calvine</hi> affirmeth it, the Iesuite denyeth it. The Creeds of the great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, and the best of the Fathers doe seeme to make for him. For they say that Christ is <hi>Deus de Deo, God of God;</hi> and that the Sonne hath nought but of the Father. God saith in my Text, that he hath begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten him; and therefore <hi>Quicquid habet, Hilar. quicquid est, August.</hi> Whatsoever he is, or hath, it is of him. But all such sayings are to be understood, not <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, not of the substance, but of the person. The essence of God is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>Damasc.</hi> neither doth beget, nor is begotten. For we learne in Philosophy, that <hi>Actiones</hi> be <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positorum.</hi> Not the Deity of the Father begat the Deity of the Sonne, but the Person of the Father begat the Person of the Son. The Creed doth not say, <hi>deit as de deitate,</hi> but <hi>Deus de Deo,</hi> that God the Sonne is of God the Father, not his Godhead, but his Person. But say it did, for indeed some Fathers doe seeme to say as much, that even the substance of the Sonne is from the Father; yet they meane no more, then that the Father is the spring head of the Godhead, and that the Sonnes deity, doth come from him, but not <hi>Nascendo,</hi> but <hi>communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cando;</hi> The Father did communicate his substance to his Sonne, but he did not beget it in his Sonne: for it is <hi>eadem Numero</hi> with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and therefore could not be begotten. Else should the third per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son be sonnne also to the first; for his Godhead is from him, as well as Christs. For he is <hi>Fons totius Deitatis,</hi> say the Fathers, all Deity is derived from him.</p>
            <p>To end this question, Christ is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, God of himselfe, as he is the Word, but <hi>Deus de Deo,</hi> God of his Father, as hee is the Sonne. My Text doth determine it in an equall eare, <hi>Thou art my Sonne, this day have I begotten thee.</hi> The aime of the argument is at the person, not at the Godhead. <hi>Ego hodie genuit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>,</hi> this day have I the Father, begotten thee the Sonne.</p>
            <p>The Law defines a Sonne, <hi>qui ex viro &amp; uxore nascitur.</hi> A child must have two parents, a man to beget him, a woman to conceive and beare him. This is the manner of the sonnes of men; but the Sonne of God had onely a Father; and the terme in my Text is suting accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, <hi>I have begotten thee.</hi> I have begotten thee? May it not then be said, that Christ was borne of God? and doth Divinity tye us to that terme, the begotten Sonne of God? Indeed some superstitious censurers of late, fearing belike lest as <hi>Orpheus</hi> sometime said, that God was <hi>mas &amp; foemina,</hi> so we should make him an Hermaphrodite,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:173124:22"/> to be of both sexes, have utterly refused that phrase, and condemned it for strange Divinitie. A strange presumption to teach Gods Spirit how to speake. For not the Fathers onely, but the Scriptures also au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorise us to say, that Christ was borne of God. For as <hi>Hillarie</hi> saith, <hi>Non est filius, qui non est natus,</hi> he is no sonne, that is not borne.</p>
            <p>The spirit in the Scriptures was not so precise; who in describing Christs issue from his Father, hath drawne his Metaphors from the womans sexe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 25. The <hi>Geneva</hi> Translators were too slight, <hi>Before the hills, was I begotten.</hi> The word hath neither the full life, nor the true sense of that in the Hebrew; it signifieth to bring forth, and that with paines, after the use of women.

Nay, God disdaineth not to mention his wombe, <hi>Psal. 110. ex utero ante luciferum genui te.</hi> Birth, travell, and wombe, all taken from women. Yea this very verse, which seemeth here to favour them, if they looke it in the Hebrew in the second <hi>Psalme,</hi> they shall find it confuteth them.

               <hi>This day have I begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten thee.</hi> The Fathers are full of the like phrases, for indeed as Saint <hi>Hilarie</hi> hath wisely determined it, <hi>Generatio &amp; Nativitas,</hi> bearing and begetting is all one with God. And in the Creede of Constantinople, there is <hi>Natus ex patre,</hi> as well as <hi>Genitus.</hi> I am too long in this point; a word of the manner; and so I will leave it.</p>

But divine genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion communicateth the whole nature; for it beareth no partition. 2. The first, being a transfusion, the substance ceaseth to be the sires; but the latter being a communication, that which the Father impartes unto the Sonne, departes not from himselfe. 3. The former is acted out of the subject; the male begetteth out of the wombe of the femall. But in the Deitie, the father begat the sonne within himselfe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Christ is said, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. to be <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE kindest argument for Christmas day, is Christs Nativity; but I have already twise preached of that project. By your learned leaves, and reverend patience, I will now for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare to touch his Incarnation, and turne my theme unto his Domination. That is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent purpose of the Apostle to presse Christs prerogative above the Angels, by a double preheminence, his Godhead, and his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. His Kingdome commended by a twofold title, the firmenes of his Seate, and the straightnesse of his Scepter. These are the points conteined in this Scripture; Christs Deity, his Royalty, his Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and his Integrity. By Gods gratious assistance, and your favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able patience, I will speake of them severally, and briefely, and as they lye in order. <hi>A love principium,</hi> I will beginne with his Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>

               <hi>Iesus</hi> the Sonne of <hi>Mary,</hi> a King, and a God? treason and blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy both at once in one Text?

               </gap> Christs arraignment, and pressed before <hi>Pilate,</hi> to bring him to his end. He had said, he was a King, <hi>Luke</hi> 23. and had made himselfe the Sonne of God. <hi>Iohn</hi> 19. 7. Yea the people also upbraided him with both, as he hung upon the Crosse. <hi>Let him come downe, if he be the Sonne of God, let him come downe, if he be the King of Israel.</hi> His
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:173124:24"/> Kingdome is my second point. But for his Godhead, ist not strange, that the Iewes should deny, that the Gentiles did confesse? that men should doubt of that, which the devils had acknowledged? Both the Romane <hi>Centurion</hi> proclaimed it at the Crosse; <hi>Doubtlesse this was the Sonne of God;</hi> and the feinds in the possessed cryed it in the way, <hi>What have we to doe with thee, thou Iesus Sonne of God?</hi> Publicans and Harlots will goe before you, said our Saviour: Nay I will speake like an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigenist, the devils themselves will goe before the Iewes into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heaven.</p>
            <p>Why then doth our Saviour commonly and openly call himselfe the sonne of Man? It was partly of his lowlinesse, and partly of his love. He that scorned not our nature, disdained not our name. But <hi>Qui dix<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t hominem, non negavit Deum;</hi> Christ when hee called him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe the sonne of Man, did not deny himselfe the Sonne of God. And justly might he chalenge God to be his Father; for God had chalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him to be his Sonne; both at his baptisme, and when hee was transfigured. <hi>This is my beloved Sonne.</hi> The seed of <hi>David</hi> but the Sonne of God. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 3. Now Gods sonne is Gods selfe: for that which is borne of God is God. It is true, which <hi>Calvin</hi> said, though in an other sense, that Christ is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>i. e.</hi> Christ is very God. His Incarnation will not disproove him; it will rather be a proofe. For it was the Word, that was incarnate, and that Word was God. The forme of a servant will not disparage him. <hi>In formam, servi transijsse, non est naturam Dei perdidisse, Hilar.</hi> The Word by taking flesh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the sonne of Man; but he did not therefore cease to be the Sonne of God. <hi>Forma servi accessit, non forma Dei recessit, August.</hi> he tooke unto him the substance of man, but he put not from him the essence of God. Even at the same time, when his entertaining of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood made him lower then the Angels, by retaining of the Godhead made him equall to his Father, both <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, both in substance and power.</p>
            <p>So he was, and so it behooved. For the greatnesse of Gods wrath, which was to be appeased, the sharpnesse of the curse, which was to be endured, and the hardnesse of the law, which was to be observed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the <hi>Messias</hi> to be more then a man. That God might be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and man might be justified, the Mediatour that must goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them both, must be both God and Man. Our Ghostly ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, the devill, death, and hell, could not be conquered by a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. As he must be man, that should encounter them; so he must be God, that could discomfit them. So he must, and so he was, God as well as Man, and therefore called <hi>Immanuel, i. e.</hi> God with us, God and man, both together in one Person.</p>
            <p>Sundry sorts of heretickes thought him <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

But the Apostle, &amp;c. not only, <hi>Deus eratcum illo, Act.</hi> 10. 28, God was with Christ, but <hi>Deus erat in illo,</hi> there was a God in Christ. A God in Christ?

            <p>There is much matter in the points behind, and indeed Christs King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is the maine marke of my Text; and therefore to end this: sonnes and their sires are of the same substance.

               </gap>; being Gods Sonne, to be also of Gods substance. Now Gods substance is God. It is an Axiome in Schoole Divinity. <hi>Quicquid est in Deo est Deus.</hi> Whatsoever is in God, is God. His Father and he were one, not onely <hi>unanimitate,</hi> as <hi>Auxen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> said the <hi>Arian,</hi> but also <hi>deiformitate,</hi> saith <hi>Hilarie,</hi> not onely in the identity of will, but also in the verity of Godhead. And so much briefly of the first point of my Text the Godhead of Christ; I come unto his Kingdome.</p>
            <p>Doe stables chamber Kings? doe mangers cradle Kings? a <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehemite,</hi> a <hi>Nazarite,</hi> a <hi>Carpenter,</hi> a <hi>King?</hi> stables are stalles for beasts, and mangers cribs for Oxen. <hi>Bethleem</hi> the least of the thousands of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> too base to beare a King. <hi>Nazareth</hi> so ignoble, that <hi>Nathanael</hi> said of it, <hi>Can any good thing come from Nazareth?</hi> And for Carpenters, it is a proverbe, <hi>tractant fabrilia fabri:</hi> more fit is for their handling a woodden rule, then a golden scepter. Yet Christ thus borne, thus brought up, thus profest, is heere by the Apostle avoucht to be a King. Avoucht? will some say: What meaneth then the Authour to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale his name, as if his heart misgave him of treason against <hi>Caesar?</hi> That is not the cause. For Christ to be a King, as my Authour doth avouch it, so the Scripture doth averre it. <hi>David</hi> calles him so, <hi>Psalme 45.

I will not say he said it; but if that silence seeme to be consent, both the people applauding him with the title; he refused it not, <hi>Luke</hi>

               </gap>9. and the Iudge opposing him of the title, he renounst it not. And when he was examined by the Romane Deputy, he disclaimed not the title but answered, <hi>thou sayest it.</hi> Nay when the high Priest asked him, whether he were so; he plainely answered, that he was, <hi>Mar. 14. 62. Herod</hi> was affraid of it, and therefore made a massacre of all the Infants about <hi>Bethleem; Pilate</hi> an Infidell wrote it on the crosse, and the seale of a <hi>Caesar</hi> upon his grave stone might argue that a King lay buried un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath. What doe I presse a point approoved by us all? For in calling
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:173124:25"/> him our Lord, wee confesse he is our King; and what Christian ever praies, but he endeth his devotion, <hi>through Iesus Christ our Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If Christ be a King, where then are his complements? Kings have their Crownes, their Thrones, and their anointing; Globes in their left hand, and Scepters in their right; the Robe royall, their Armes, and their Stiles; their Courts, and their Nobles, their Guard, and their Champion; swords are borne before them, and the people crie, God save the King. A goodly King, will some blasphemer say, some <hi>Lucian,</hi> some <hi>Porphyrie,</hi> some <hi>Iulian,</hi> some <hi>Iew.</hi> He wore a crowne, but made of thornes, and he bore a Scepter, but it was a reede; he was mounted on a throne, but it was the Crosse; and a title over it, but for a malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor; his Court some ship or mountaine, and his Nobles, Publicans and Fishermen; <hi>Peter</hi> his champion, but a silly maiden made him to forsweare him; a Purple garment was put upon him, and the souldiers knees were bent before him, and they cried unto him, but all in scorne, <hi>All haile King of the Iewes.</hi> Thou impious Atheist, knowest thou not that those complements are of Kings of this world? And readest thou not, Christs Kingdome was not of this world. And yet because thou urgest them, to prove Christ was no King, I say Christ hath them all, and therefore is a King. For Throne and Scepter, my text affordeth them; Thou Atheist understandest them not; but when Christ shall come to judgement, then shalt thou tremble before his throne, and be smitten into hell with the stroke of his Scepter. He beares his Vnction in his name, he was termed the <hi>Messias, i.</hi> the anointed, and wee call him Christ, because (saith the <hi>Psalmist) The Lord hath anointed him with the oyle of gladnesse above his fellowes.</hi> His Crowne, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 14. 14. not of thornes, but of gold. The world is his globe, and hee meates it with his fist, <hi>Esay</hi> 40. 12. Heaven is his Court, and the Angells his Nobilitie; and his Guard thousand thousands of Saints, and ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand thousands of Cherubims, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 10. His Armes are the Crosse; so the Fathers conster that <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. which himselfe calls the signe of the sonne of man. <hi>Daniel</hi> saw his Robe, a garment white as snow; his stile is on his thigh, <hi>Apoc. 19. 16. Rex regum dominus dominantium.</hi> His Word is his Sword, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 12. and his Martyrs are his Champions; and the people saluted him, as he rode into Ierusalem, with a solemne <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanna, Luke 19. Benedictus Rex, Blessed be the King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If Christ be a King, then what is his Kingdome? It it not like to king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms upon earth. As he said of his peace, <hi>Ioh. 14. Not as the world giveth, give I unto you;</hi> so may he say of his power, not as the world raigneth, raigne I over you; his kingdome is spirituall. The Iewes confessing that their <hi>Messias</hi> was to be a king, thought Christ was not he, because his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage was not like a king. They thought he should dissesin <hi>Herod</hi> of his diademe, &amp; throw <hi>Cesar</hi> out of his throne. But his dominion is <hi>supra,</hi> not <hi>contra,</hi> above Kings, not against Kings. It is the Churches Hymne, <hi>non e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripit mortalia, qui regna dat coelestia,</hi> the kings of all lands are his Lievete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants by him, and under him they rule their realmes; his people he sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecteth unto their scepters; only the supremacie reserves unto himself.</p>
            <p>Nor was the end of Christs comming in the flesh presently to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse his princely jurisdiction. The drift of his descending was not <hi>ad
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:173124:25"/> judicandum,</hi> but <hi>ad salvandum,</hi> not to be a Iudge, but to be a Saviour. The nature of his office was engraven in his name, expounded by the Angell, <hi>Matth.</hi> 1. he should <hi>be called Iesus, for he should save his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> And yet it pleased him to shew sometimes some signes of his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie. As his sending for the Asse, without first asking leave of him that owned it; and his answer if the owner sticke at it, <hi>Dominus opus ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet;</hi> as if he should say, the King must use it. And his driving of the Merchants out of the Temple; a notorious presumption for a private man▪ besides some other particulars in the Gospell. But after his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection hee plainely professed his imperiall power, by sending his disciples out into all Realmes, into the kingdomes of all Princes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their licence, as being a higher power than they. And now hee governes the world invisibly; even as a King being resident but in one place, yet is President in all; his palace but in one citie, but his power in all; so though his person abide among the Angels, and his seate be with the Saints, yet his power reacheth over all the world. Though his majestie be in heaven, yet his authority is on earth. His destruction of the wicked, and protection of his Church, do prove his princely power.</p>
            <p>Christs Kingdome, I say, is not carnal, but spirituall; and yet not meere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly spirituall. For as he hath his word, so hee hath his sword. As he that his spirit, which is the holy Ghost to confirme the faithfull: so he hath his spirits which are the holy Angels to confound the wilfull. The Pope saith he hath, but Christ indeed hath <hi>utrunque gladium,</hi> both the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and the spirituall sword; the one for the conversion of his children, the other for the subversion of his enemies. The sword of his mouth, <hi>i.</hi> his word beateth downe sin, the mouth of his sword, <hi>i.</hi> his vengeance eateth up sinners. His spiritual sword is forspirituall wickednesses, which are the devill and the flesh; it is his mouth sword-by his Preachers; you have it, <hi>Apoc</hi> 1. 16. this temporall sword, is for temporall enemies, which are the vexers of his Church; It is his hand-sword by his Angels; even his sword of two mouthes (my author cals it <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (<hi>Cha. 4. v.</hi> 12. of two mouthes; <hi>i.</hi> edges, that is his two-hand sword; with the one side to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat their purposes, with the other to revenge the practises of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbers of his people.</p>
            <p>This Kingdome of Christs is more perfect and excellent, then ever was the Kingdome of any earthly Prince in five respects; the first, the right of his Title; the second, the fulnesse of his power; the third, the number of his subjects; the fourth, the soveraignitie of his Rule; and the fifth, the continuance of his raigne. I will speake of them severally.</p>
            <p>For the first, his titles to his crowne are both moe, and more honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> his claime is fivefold; first for his hypostaticall, his personall union. In that the man Christ is also God; he is Lord of all creatures, whatsoever, wheresoever; that as when an earthly King is named, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie subject doth his reverence; so at the name of Iesus every knee must bow, of things in heaven, in earth, and under earth. His second claime <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> is by right of redemption. For the Civilians have a rule, <hi>Emptum cedit in jus emptoris.</hi> Surely if sinne subjected us to Sathan, and the Devill plead his Conquest, to prove himselfe our King, by winning us from God; Christ that hath rescued us by his power, and recovered us by
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:173124:26"/> his price, hath more right to be our Lord. His third title is by inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Is not the sonne of man, also the Sonne of God? And is not the Father Lord of all the creatures? If then he be his Sonne, he also is his heire. It is Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> argument: and you heard it also in the Epistle, that the Father hath made his Sonne heire of all things. The onely rubbe that might be in this reason is, if God had more sonnes, and Christ were not the eldest. But he is both <hi>unigenitus,</hi> Gods onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Sonne, he hath no moe; and if he had, yet is he also <hi>primogeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> his first begotten Sonne, <hi>vers. 6. hujus cap.</hi> His fourth plea, is of Merit, In that hee satisfied his Fathers wrath, and recompenst the wrong, which we had done Gods honour by his owne death; hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served all the honour, which his father might doe him. Yea both his active merit, his obedience of the Law, and his passive merit, his pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on the Crosse; his absolute obeying of the Law, and his resolute abiding of the Crosse have duely deserved it. His last right is by Donation. The gift is promised, <hi>Psal. 2. Tibi dabo, I will give;</hi> and it is performed, <hi>Matth. 28. Mihi data est, All power is given me.</hi> Christ tooke possession, when hee tooke flesh; that was his induction, my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor calls it so, <hi>vers.</hi> 6. and though the Priests disclaimed him, <hi>Iohn 19. Wee have no King;</hi> yet the people proclaimed him, <hi>Luke 19. Benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus Rex, blessed be the King.</hi> The devill proffered him all the kingdomes of the earth, an other <hi>Tibi dabo, Matth.</hi> 4. 9. but that gift was naught; for they were none of his. But here the owner is the doner. Gods is the Kingdome, and he gives it to his Sonne; and if mens Patents be of force, Gods <hi>Magna Charta</hi> is much more. The people would have made Christ King, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 15. but he would not take it of them, but of God. And therefore his Father calls him his King, <hi>Psa. 2. I have set my King,</hi> and the Evangelist seconds it, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 26. he calls him the Lords Christ. That as Princes and Prelates have their places <hi>divina digna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione,</hi> so Christ hath also his, <hi>divina donatione.</hi> That as <hi>Charles</hi> our earthly King writeth in his stile, <hi>Charles by the Grace of God King of three lands:</hi> So Christ our heavenly King may write in his stile, <hi>Iesus by the gift of God King of all lands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second excellencie in Christs Kingdome, is the fulnesse of his power. The power of earthly Kings hath limitation. Their subjects are not bound to obey them in all things. Their lusts are listed by their lawes. But Christs power is peremptorie; <hi>quod volumus, sanctum est:</hi> what he bids, must be: what he forbids, his subjects must not doe. The commandes of Kings have many exceptions; but Christs authoritie is absolute and infinite.</p>
            <p>The third consideration, is the number of subjects. It is the Wise mans word, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14. that the multitude of people is the honour of a King. Mens kingdomes have their bounds, and their rule doth reach no further then their Realmes. But Christs Kingdome is in all countries, and all people subject to his power. <hi>Sesostris</hi> King of Egypt called him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, an Oecumenicall King. So saith the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> the whole world is his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, and his possession, the ends of the earth. For though his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome be not of the world, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 18. yet the kingdome of the world is his,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:173124:26"/>
               <hi>Apo.</hi> 11 Nay more than that, Kings are commanders but of those that live, the dead are out of their dominion. But Christ, as at the last day he shall be Iudge both of quicke and dead; so in the meane time hee is King both over quicke and dead. For the soules of the Saints are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to his Scepter. Nay more than that, the mightiest Monarke is but ruler over men; but Christ is Lord also over the Angels. Both <hi>Michael</hi> and his Angels, and the <hi>Dragon</hi> and his Angels owe alledgeance unto him The one doe worship him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 6. the other doe feare him, <hi>Iames</hi> 2 19. both do serve him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 7. And therfore as the Pope doth weare a triple crowne, to signifie his threefold power, in earth, in heaven, and in Purgatorie: so Christ, who indeed hath regall authoritie, both in earth, heaven, and hell, is seene in the <hi>Apocal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>pse,</hi> 19. 12. to have many crownes upon his head.</p>
            <p>The fourth prerogative in Christs Kingdome, is his suremacie. Some Kings have controllers upon earth. The <hi>Spartanes</hi> had officers that might call their King to count, that might summon him, and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure him. The <hi>Romane</hi> Tribune might arrest the Consuls, who were in <hi>Rome</hi> as Kings. But Christs Kingdome is uncontroleable; what he will, hee workes, and none may say unto him, <hi>quid agis,</hi> What dost thou? In earth on King is vassall to another. So was <hi>Herod</hi> unto <hi>Caesar,</hi> and so are many Kings unto the Turkish Emperour. But Christs Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hath no superiour; hee is no homager unto any; for his Diademe hath no dependance. Nay all Kings doe homage unto him; <hi>the Kings of Tharsis, and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

In a word, his stile is embroidered on his robe, and his title on his thigh, <hi>Rex regum, &amp; dominus dominantium, Lord of Lords, and King of Kings.</hi> Indeed the Turkish <hi>Sultan</hi> hath the one in his stile, <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus dominantium,</hi> and <hi>Syrus</hi> the Persian had the other on his tombe, <hi>Rex regum.</hi> But these did but usurpe; as the haughtie hearts of man will leave the Lord no title.

               </gap>, that is, a King of Kings raigning over all that raigne. But Christ onely indeed is the supreme soveraigne, and the Arch-Emperour over all Kings. Heathens conceive it not; but Christian Kings confesse it; and therefore as servants doe weare their Lords cognisance, so doe they set the Crosse, which is Christs cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisance, on the crest of their crownes.</p>
            <p>The fifth and last perfection, is the continuance of Christs Kingdome, and is the next point in my text. <hi>Thy seat O God endureth for ever.</hi> Thy throne? Heaven is his throne; it endureth not for ever. Himselfe hath said it, that heaven and earth shall passe, But heaven is not meant here; the terme is metonymicall and meaneth his regiment; it endu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eth for ever. There are two causes of Kings non-continuance, Death, and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:173124:27"/> Disturbance Death unheads the crowne, or force uncrownes the head. I name not Resignation, because it is voluntary.</p>
            <p>For the first, the raigne of a King determines at his death; his rule ceaseth, when himselfe deceaseth, and the expiring of his Ghost is the period of his power. Christ dyed indeed, but yet he kept his Kingdome, because he dyed not. What (will you say) did not Christ dye? saith not the Creed, he did: say not the Scriptures also, that he did? this is palpable heresie. I say againe, Christ dyed not; and yet I crosse not either Creed or Scripture. They say he dyed, and so say I; but I say he lived too, and so say they. For death and life are not contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in Christ. <hi>Moriebatur, &amp; non moriebatur. Ambro. Emisit spiritum, non amisit. i. e.</hi> Had he beene <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, but a meere man, he had lost his Kingdome with his life. But Saint <hi>Paul</hi> telleth us as you heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Deus erat in Christo,</hi> there was a God in Christ. There was <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus homo,</hi> The man Christ, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. and there was <hi>Christus Dominus,</hi> the Lord Christ, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 11. Christ was both quicke and dead at once, because he was both God and man at once. The man Christ dyed, but the Lord Christ lived. He dyed but in part, the living part kept still the Kingdome. Though the parts of his manhood, his body and his soule were severed by death; yet his Godhead continued united still unto them both. His Kingdome was tyed to neither of his natures, but to his Person. That Person remaining still whole for all his death, he could not lose his Kingdome.</p>
            <p>Kingdomes remoove from man to man by death. But Christs King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is like unto his Priesthood, its <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 24. not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighable to others by succession. As his Miter, so his Scepter, the one slippeth not from head to head, the other slideth not from hand to hand. The reason is there rendred, <hi>His raigne is for ever,</hi> because his life is for ever. As he weare the one, so he beares the other for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting.</p>
            <p>For the second cause of non-continuance, which was disturbance. Kings are sometimes un-kingd. Either intruders at home despoile them of their Diademes, or invaders from abroad thrust them from their Thrones. There is a law entitles every man to a crowne, yea though it be already upon an others head. <hi>Polybius</hi> calles it <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the law of hands. If the aspirers sword be sharper, and his arme be stronger, he relies upon that law, <hi>Qui potest capere, capiat,</hi> catch it, who can; if he can winne it, he will weare it. But Christ who is Almighty, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 1 8. hath none mightier then himselfe. The strong man in Christs Parable, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. keepeth his palace, till a stronger then he commeth, and overcommeth. But there is no <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, none stronger then Christ, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 22. His palace is impregnable, no strength on earth can stirre his Crowne, nor wrest his Scepter out of his hand. <hi>Daniel</hi> avoucheth it before a King, even the mightiest then on earth, that Christs King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome should never be destroyed, nor his Dominion be given to an other. What ground <hi>Tertullian</hi> had to say the Romane Empire should <hi>stare in seculum,</hi> should stand for ever, I doe not know. All Empires have had their ends. But the continuance of Christs Kingdome is grounded on Gods Word, and that repeated often, that his Throne is for ever.</p>
            <pb n="43" facs="tcp:173124:27"/>
            <p>Is Christs Throne for ever, and as <hi>Gabriel</hi> said to <hi>Mary,</hi> of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome shall there be no end? How then saith the Apostle 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. that there shall be an end? and Christ shall at length deliver up his Kingdome? It is indeed a Scripture apprehended by the Arians to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proove Christs Div<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nity; but answered with ease. That which is there said of Christ, is meant onely of his manhood. Our late writers answer so. But be it that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> meant it of Christs Godhead. Christ shall not so give up the Kingdome to his Father, that himselfe shall cease to raigne. The Fathers answer so: All Power (saith our Saviour) both in Heaven and Earth, is given me of my Father. Shall I therefore say, the Father was quite stript of it himselfe? Nay, but as the Kingdome, which the Father gave the Sonne, is called the Fathers Kingdome ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse, <hi>Math. 26. Non ita tradet, &amp; ipse, amittat, August.</hi> So Christ shall returne it, and yet retaine it too; and as Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> speaketh, <hi>ipsius datio,</hi> is not <hi>suiipsius fraudatio.</hi> It was a communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it was not an abdication. It is a tradition, it is not a perdition.</p>
            <p>Haply this doctrine may seeme absurd to some, and it may be you will aske me, as <hi>Mary</hi> did the Angell, <hi>quomodo fiet istud, how may this be?</hi> I say with Saint <hi>Ambrose,</hi> that <hi>regni traditio</hi> is not <hi>regnandi de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectio,</hi> our Saviour shall resigne his raigne, and yet himselfe not cease to raigne. For two things are contained in the terme of raigne, <hi>Vnctio &amp; Functio,</hi> that is, Dominion, and Execution; <hi>Regem esse, &amp; Regem agere,</hi> to have the place and dignity of a King; and to doe the part and duty of a King. To weare the Crowne, to beare the Scepter, to sit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Throne, and to have the peoples knees bended before him, this is to be a King. Christ in this sense shall raigne for ever, he shall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe this honour to his Father, but shall raigne for ever with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For his Fathers Throne disturbes not his, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 7. 21. there are both their Thrones at once. But the functions of a King, to sit in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to reward deservers, to punish evill doers, to rescue the oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, to fight with the enemy, Christ in this sense shall cease to raigne after the day of judgement, which is the last act of his Kingdome, and shall deliver up the Kingdome to his Father.</p>
            <p>The Elect are Gods Kingdome, their soules and bodies both are his 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. Sathan plaies <hi>Rex</hi> with the one, and so doth sinne; Death doth domineere, and the World doth tyrannize over the other. God hath committed this Kingdome unto Christ, the Father to the Sonne, to the Sonne incarnate, by his merits, by his sufferings, by his Word, and by his Spirit to recover his people, and to subdue those usurpers. This worke will not be fully wrought untill the resurrection, when Death the last enemy shall be discomfited. Then Christ shall present the Elect unto his Father, which the Apostle calleth the delivery of his Kingdome. For when the Church Militant, shall become triumphant, the Father then shall raigne in the Saints by himselfe. He raigned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but by his Sonne; he was his Delegate, and Vice-roy in his stead. But then his Scepter shall be surrendred, and the Father imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately shall raigne by himselfe.</p>
            <p>Desire to be conceived makes me long in this; to end it; Christs endlesse Kingdome, never to determine, as the Iewes confesse of the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:173124:28"/>

The Scripture is rich in this position: the continuance of Christs Kingdome. But I doubt I have sat too long up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Seate, I will now proceed unto his Scepter.</p>
            <p>Are not all Scepters right? Though some Kings are not, yet all Scepters are. But as the Throne before was put for regiment, so by the Scepter now is meant the governement; and Kings Scepters are too often crooked in that sense.

Gods heavenly Herald began his <hi>Oiez</hi> there; that verse hath the Proeme of his Proclamation. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie word in it maketh him way unto atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In manner of a crie, he beginneth with an <hi>Ecce,</hi> that is the <hi>Oiez.</hi> He bringeth tidings; the name of newes commandes the audience of the eare.

Now this verse which I have read, hath the narration of those tidings; there they were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, there they are expounded. Every word tending to the proofe of the theme there generally premised. For what are those tidings of such joy, and to so many? [The conjunctionall particle brings them on

               </gap>, namely, and to wit; that is, saith the Angell: What is?] First, <hi>Natus est, there is borne.</hi> We hold it just occasion for to joy a Parent, when a child is borne. <hi>Abraham</hi> and his wife, but at the promise of a child, were ravished with such joy, that they burst out into laughter. In so much that God set the signe of their passion in the name of their sonne, and called him <hi>Isaac,</hi> which signifieth <hi>laughter.</hi> Yea the word hath yet more, for the enlarging of this joy, the sexe of the child, <hi>natus est,</hi> a male child is borne; a matter of such moment to the mother of the infant, that her joy, that a man is borne into the world, makes her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently forget the grievous paines and anguish of her travell. Secondly, <hi>to you;</hi> lest the shepheards might reply, <hi>cui bono,</hi> to whose good is it? the Angell preventeth them: the joy did reach to them, for the birth concerned them, [<hi>There is borne to you.</hi>] Thirdly, <hi>this day;</hi> the very name of newes is pleasing to the eare; and the newer they be, the welcomer they be: the tidings of the Angell are of a fresh occurrent; and the newes, as we use to speake in common phrase, they are as new, as day: <hi>there is borne to you this day.</hi> Fourthly, <hi>a Saviour.</hi> To men in dolour, in danger, in distresse: what newes so delightfull, as the noise of a Deliverer? Fifthly, <hi>which is Christ the Lord.</hi> That a child was borne, borne to their good, that very day, that should be their Saviour; all these strong motives of conceit of joy. But that that new borne Babe, was the <hi>Messias;</hi> whom they had long looked for, long longed for; and that <hi>Messias</hi> was also a God; the Scripture is silent; but me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinkes I should conceive, that as old <hi>Iacob</hi> at the newes of <hi>Ioseph,</hi> whom he had thought had beene long before devoured, when his sonnes as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured him, not onely of his life, but also of his honour and authoritie in <hi>Egypt,</hi> his spirits failed him, and he fainted for joy; so these silly shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards at the birth of him, whom they so much desired, with the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den flow of superabundant joy at once, their hearts could not hold, but they fell into an extasie. Sixthly and lastly, <hi>In the citie of David.</hi> It skills not smally to the encrease of joy, to lay the object of it neere. The wise men of the East were faine to come from farre to visite Christ. The shepheards needed but to goe into the towne, hee was borne in <hi>Bethleem,</hi> hard by the fields, where their flockes were now pasturing. This is the context and coherence of this Scripture with the verse before.</p>

Of these seven particulars, or of so many of them, as the shortnesse of the houre, and the weakenesse of my voyce will let, by Gods gracious assistance, &amp;c. I will speake of at this time severally and briefely.</p>
            <pb n="47" facs="tcp:173124:29"/>
            <p>For the first; it is a point profounder, then mans shallow reason may presume to reach Gods descending unto Incarnation, is transcending mans imagination. Man that is blind in many workes of nature, shall he presume to pry into the God of nature. The point here propounded is the Lords birth; how shal I dare speake of it, it beseeming not the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, as Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> saith, <hi>de Natalibus Domini disputare,</hi> to be so bold as to reason of the birth of his Lord. But there is, saith Saint <hi>Bernard. Laudabilis Curiositas,</hi> a commendable Curiosity in the sober search of Mysteries. Christs incarnation, though it cannot <hi>demonstrari,</hi> yet it may <hi>illustrari,</hi> though it cannot be expressed how it is, yet it may be expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded what it is. It is the comming downe of the glorious Sonne of God, into the base wombe of a poore simple Virgin: there forming of her seed, first sanctified by his Spirit, and so free from sinne, a humane substance, and uniting that nature unto his blessed Godhead into one individuall and personall subsistence; bred of her flesh, without the helpe of man; fed of her substance until the day of birth, and now borne of her body, by the way of all Infants. The Scripture is rich in the proofe of these particulars, were it that I preached unto hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call hearers, such as in times past have impugned Christs huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p>Now that God should vouchsafe to debase himselfe thus farre, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parage his Divinity by the union of our flesh; and how his sacred Deity could close into one person with the humane nature, that is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, saith St. <hi>Cyrill,</hi> speech cannot expresse it, thought cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it. <hi>Secretum meum mihi, Secretum meum mihi,</hi> saith the Lord, God hath reserved those secrets to himselfe. Every sober Christian must (as St. <hi>Basil</hi> wisheth) <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, rather se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously adore the doer, then curiously enquire the manner. For as saith the same Father, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the manner is above enquiry; our Saviours Incarnation is beyond examination. The secret of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours sacred Nativity, <hi>nec Apostolus didicit,</hi> neither Apostle learned it, neither Prophet sounded it, neither Angell understood it, saith <hi>Tertul. Luther</hi> was wont to say, God will not haue us <hi>Quaerists;</hi> I may better say in this, God will not have us <hi>quomodists.</hi> For why Christ was In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate, the Scripture hath reveiled that, but how he was incarnate, the Scripture hath concealed that. Indeed the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> was bold to aske the question, <hi>Luke 1. 34. Quomodo fiet hoc? how may this be?</hi> But her question respected not Christs Divinity, but her Virginity; soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous not of the copulation of his Godhead, but of the violation of her Maydenhead.</p>
            <p>Thus then the Lord of Glory tooke unto himselfe the shape of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, the Word who was God, <hi>homini coinfantiatum est,</hi> saith <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> became an Infant to be made Man. Man was first made after Gods I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage; but now God was made after mans Image. God said of man in Irony, behold man is become like one of us; but we may say of God in earnest, behold, God is become like one of us. The saying of the Poet cited by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> was, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, we are Gods generation; but we may turne it now into <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; God is our generation, God and man have enterchanged titles; Man is called the Sonne of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:173124:30"/> God, <hi>Luke</hi> 3. 38. and God is called the Sonne of Man. The ancient of dayes is now become an Infant, made of a woman, whom himselfe had made; borne in those armes, which he had framed, and sucketh those brests which he had filled.</p>
            <p>We wonder now no more at the Creatures, the earthes hanging in the aire, the bounding of the sea, the bottles of Heaven, and the wheele of nature; by which as <hi>Hilary</hi> speaketh, <hi>quaedam arent, quaedam virent,</hi> all things doe duely keepe their course. But now we wonder at the Creator; <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Basil.</hi> the great God became a little Childe, the Lord of glory in a Virgins wombe; the founder of the world rocked in a Cradle, the Almighty swathed in Infants clouts, and he that is <hi>Regens sydera,</hi> the sterner of the starres, to be <hi>Sugens vbera, August.</hi> to sucke a womans brests, it is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Nemes.</hi> a most incredible thing. The Word, who is God, to become Flesh; God who is a Spirit, to assume a body, Majesty to put on mortality, God to become man, this is indeed, as the Poet speaketh, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to turne up side downe, this is I say indeed, as we speake in proverbe, heaven and earth to goe together.</p>
            <p>In the workes of nature, there is yet some reason, in which the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious searcher resteth in some measure. But in this mystery of Gods In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, there is nothing but wonderment. The wit not able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, the tongue may cry out, <hi>O Altitudo,</hi> Oh the depth of the wisdome, and the power of God. A Virgin to compasse a man, <hi>Ieremie</hi> calleth it a new thing in earth; nay a Virgin to compasse a God, it may be termed a new thing in Heaven; worthy the wonder of the Angels; yea were it not, God saith, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. that nothing can be wonderfull to him, worthy the wonderment of God himselfe. It is his worke, his strange worke, his act, his strange act.</p>
            <p>To shut up this point, God manifested in the flesh, the Apostle cals it a great mystery. If any shall moove questions, how it could bee, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, saith <hi>Iustine Martyr,</hi> faith must dissolve them. And yet, saith Saint <hi>August.</hi> Christs Incarnation, though it be not <hi>dicibilis,</hi> yet it was <hi>visibilis.</hi> Though we know not, how it was; yet we doubt not, that it was. Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> tels us plainely in the beginning of his first Epistle, that the eye saw it, and the hand felt it. And his sleepe, his teares, his hunger, his thirst, his agony and his death, all pregnantly prooved it. If any be yet curious, and desire to know the manner of the Incarnation; as the Angell answered <hi>Manoah,</hi> enquiring of his name, <hi>Why askest thou my name, seeing it is wonderfull,</hi> so say I unto him, Why enquirest thou the manner, seeing it is a mystery? For as <hi>Athanasius</hi> speaketh, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; a Mystery re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veiled, is no more admired; might the manner be made knowne, it were not then a wonder. <hi>Tu ratiocinare, ego mirabor, tu disputa, ego cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, August.</hi> in an other case; it is a mystery; doe thou dispute it, if thou wilt; I will beleeve it, I will admire it, I will adore it. And so much for, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The next thing I propounded, was the benefit of Christs Birth; for it followeth in my Text, <hi>There is borne to you, natus est vobis.</hi> As some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Priests said unto <hi>Iudas,</hi> so might the Shepheards have said
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:173124:30"/> unto the Angell, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, you tell us of a birth; but what is that to us? The pronominall terme is indifferently here meant either to the shepheards personally, or to the <hi>Iewes</hi> nationally, or to all mankind ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally. For if, as the Christians say, <hi>Favores</hi> be <hi>ampliandi,</hi> the favours of the Law must be expounded with the largest, the grace of the Gospel must much more be consterd so. Christs birth it was for them; behold (saith God) to <hi>Sion, thy King commeth unto thee, Zach.</hi> 9. 9. but it also was for us; <hi>Puer natus est nobis, A child is borne to us, Esay</hi> 9. 6. Vnto whom God promised him, to them he performed him. The promises pertained to the <hi>Iewes, Rom.</hi> 9. 4. but they also pertained unto us. For as we are inserted into their stocke, so are we nourished from their root; and <hi>Abrams</hi> seede, which is this babe now borne, hath brought a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to all nations upon earth.</p>
            <p>And as to all Nations, so to all conditions. Both to male and female; hee was borne in mans sexe, but made of womans seed, that hee might save both; that not man onely might say with the Prophet, I will waite on God my Saviour, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7. 7. but the woman also might sing with the Virgine, <hi>my spirit rejoyceth in God my Saviour.</hi> Both to young and old; as hee lived to perfect age, so to intitle the elder unto Paradise; so was he borne a little infant, that of such might be the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven. Both the poore and rich; the stable was his chamber, the litter his bed, and the cribbe his cradell, that the poore may not despaire to be in <hi>Abrahams</hi> bosome; and the wise men of the East pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented him with gold, that the rich may understand, that this day sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is come unto their house. The Lord is no respecter of persons; as well the bondservant, that grindeth at the mill, as the King that sits upon the throne, is benefited by Christs birth.</p>
            <p>The reverend Fathers of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Councell, thought this little pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne worthy of their Creed; <hi>that for us men, and for our salvation Christ was incarnate, and was made man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Christs birth was for us; <hi>Socrates</hi> Apophthegme was, <hi>Quae supra nos, nihil ad nos.</hi> But Christs birth, though it be <hi>supra nos,</hi> yet it is <hi>ad nos,</hi> though it surpasseth our conceit, yet it maketh for our benefit. <hi>Platoes</hi> proverbe, <hi>Nemo sibi nascitur,</hi> no man is borne onely for himselfe, but for his countrey, his parents and his friends, can not be said so truely of any, as of Christ. Hee was not borne at all for himselfe, but meerely for others. All his doings, all his sufferings, they were for us. For us he did the Law, for us he had the Law. Both his active obedience, his fulfilling of the Law, was in our names; and his passive obedience, his sustaining of the Crosse, was in our stead. Both his Incarnation at the first, <hi>Puer natus est nohis;</hi> a child was borne for us; and his condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at the last, <hi>filius datus est nobis,</hi> Gods Sonne was given for us, <hi>Esay</hi> 9. 6. And so much also for the second Point.</p>
            <p>The third thing in my text, is the time of Christs birth: <hi>Natus est hodie, there is borne to you this day.</hi> The appearance of the Angell to the shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards at this time, it is to bring them newes of Christs birth. Newes have their name, <hi>à novitate;</hi> they are not newes, if they be stale. Christ being borne in the night, as the storie seemes to signifie, God differres not the tidings till the next day, but presently dispatcheth his
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:173124:31"/> ministring Spirit, and the Angell at the instant beares the newes unto the shepheards. Many dayes, many yeares, many ages had the <hi>Iewes</hi> waited long for the comming of the <hi>Messias.</hi> His Father often promised him, to <hi>Adam,</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to <hi>David. Balaam</hi> and <hi>Moses,</hi> and many later Prophets had foretold hee should come. The length of the delay might have forced the <hi>Iewes</hi> in regard of the former, to have said with the mockers, 2 <hi>Pet. 3. Where is the promise of his comming?</hi> and for the later, that in the fifth of <hi>Ieremie; Prophetae prophetant mendacium, the Prophets prophesie lies.</hi> Himselfe had said in <hi>Davids</hi> time, <hi>Psal. 40. 8. Ecce vemo, Behold I come;</hi> and yet there had passed above twentie gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and hee not come. When now faith was enfeebled by long looking after him, and hope began to faint even among those, who waited and watched for the redemption of <hi>Israel;</hi> then came the joyfull Embassie of the blessed Angell, and brought unto the shepheards the newes of Christs Nativitie.</p>
            <p>The comming of Christ, the Patriarkes desired it, Prophets and Kings desired it, yea Angells desired it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. But times and seasons are not at mans election, but at Gods prescription; the time of Christs Incarnation, fore set by Gods predestination, and the Lord performeth, as the <hi>Iewes</hi> speake in their proverbe, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> every thing in his just time. Christs comming was not in the first age of the world; God onely promised him unto the Patriarkes; nor in the middle age, <hi>David</hi> and the Prophets onely foretold of him. But God sent his Sonne in the fulnesse of time, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4. in the last dayes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 2. When as now neither God himselfe appeared, nor Angell descended, nor Prophet remained, then the Word incarnate thought it time for him, to say that in the <hi>Psalm, Ecce venio, Loe I come.</hi> The expectation of the Gentiles, and the longing of the Iewes, long was he looked for, now at length hee is come.</p>
            <p>There is borne to you this day: there are two birthes of Christ <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, saith <hi>Theophylact,</hi> Christ hath two goings forth; one of his Godhead, <hi>Egressus ejus à diebus aeternitatis, Mic.</hi> 5. the birth of his deitie is from everlasting. The other of his manhood, and that is at this time. Now is <hi>sempiternus</hi> become <hi>hodiernus, Aug.</hi> he that from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting is the Sonne of God, began this day to be the Sonne of man. The Poets have a god, whom they call <hi>Bis genitum,</hi> for so they faigne <hi>Bacchus</hi> to be twise borne. It were a wonder, if it were a truth. But the Poets stories, <hi>Cato</hi> tells us, are <hi>miranda non credenda,</hi> wonderments, but figments. But Christ is so indeed, Gods <hi>unigenitus</hi> is <hi>bis genitus;</hi> hee that first was Gods onely begotten Sonne, is now the Virgins first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten sonne: both a wonder, <hi>Can a man,</hi> saith <hi>Nicodemus, be borne the second tine?</hi> and a truth, for it is Gospell.</p>
            <p>This he that was ancient to the whole world, became a Punie unto all his creatures; <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> was made <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Methodius. Abraham</hi> hath seede elder than himselfe, and as <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> speaketh in an other sense, he commeth after me, that was before me. Man is become an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to his owne maker. For <hi>Iob</hi> hath said of us, <hi>hesterni sumus, Iob</hi> 8. 9. we are borne yesterday: but the Angell saith of Christ, <hi>natus est hodie,</hi> he was but borne to day. He that ordereth all ages from the bosome of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:173124:31"/> his Father, is issued this day from the wombe of his mother.</p>
            <p>To end this; that of the <hi>Arians,</hi> recorded by <hi>Theodoret,</hi> is true of Christ, though not in their sense, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>erat, quando non erat,</hi> there was a time when Christ was not. For his humane nature was a creature, and therefore not eternall. Of that humane nature the Angell here speaketh, <hi>natus est vobis hodie,</hi> it is borne to us this day. And so much for the third point.</p>
            <p>The fourth thing propounded, is the purpose of Christs comming; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> it is to be a Saviour. <hi>Natus est vobis hodiè salvator.</hi> For that ancient terme found in the vulgar Translation, and ever used by all the Latine Fathers, I hold it fittest to retaine. They are too fine that translate it <hi>ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vator,</hi> a word short of the Emphasis of the Originall, confessed by <hi>Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies</hi> selfe, who could judge of Latine better than they. Saint <hi>Gregorie</hi> observeth, that the <hi>Iewes</hi> bestow this title upon God the Father; but here the Angell conferres it upon Christ. Yea God himselfe proclaimes it, <hi>Esay 62. Tell the daughter Sion, Ecce salvator tuus venit, behold thy Saviour commeth.</hi> Yea often in the Scriptures Christ is commended to the <hi>Iewes</hi> under the name of a Saviour. The act indeed of saving be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs in common to the whole Trinitie; the Father and the Spirit may be enstiled Saviours, as well as Christ; but they <hi>authoritativè,</hi> onely Christ <hi>executivè, Bern.</hi> and therefore the name of Iesus is appropriate to him, and he called <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Gods salvation, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 30.</p>
            <p>The rescuers of <hi>Israel</hi> from the yoke of Tyrants are called Saviours in the phrase of Scripture. <hi>Iosua, Samsom, Gideon,</hi> and many others, the Worthies of the world are titled by that terme. But it is bestowed on this infant here in a farre diviner sense. <hi>Othniel</hi> is called a Saviour, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 3. 9. because he saved <hi>Israel</hi> from <hi>Cusan</hi> of <hi>Neharaim,</hi> that is, by interpretation, from the Blacke-more of <hi>Syria.</hi> But Christ hath better right to the claime of that title; for he hath saved us from Sathan, the Blacke-more of hell. Nay <hi>Ioseph</hi> is called by <hi>Pharaoh, Salvator mundi,</hi> the Saviour of the world, <hi>Gen.</hi> 41. because by his providence in the dayes of famine, <hi>Egypt</hi> was fed with bread. But Christ is indeed the Saviour of the world, <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 42. for hee is himselfe the bread of life, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. 45. They all were Saviours, but <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> not <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in title rather than in birth. But Christ is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as the <hi>Samaritans</hi> there acknowledge him; the Saviour indeed, the mightie deliverer of all that cleave to him: not from the temporall molestations of worldly oppressors, but from the spirituall machinations of ghostly oppugners; a terme so true, nay so proper unto him, that it was given him from his name; hee was called <hi>Iesus,</hi> that is to say a Saviour.</p>
            <p>The act excellent, the salvation of man, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Clem. Alex.</hi> the greatest and royallest of all the acts of God; and the name eminent, a name above all names, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 9. that at the name of Iesus all things shall bow the knee, both <hi>homines &amp; daemones, Basil.</hi> not onely men and Angels, but the devills also; if their knees would not bend in honour of his name, yet they should beate one against the other at the terrour of his name.</p>
            <p>Is there borne to us a Saviour? What is it then, that he should save us from? Not <hi>Egypt,</hi> or <hi>Amaleke,</hi> not <hi>Madian,</hi> or <hi>Moab,</hi> not the <hi>Philistims</hi>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:173124:32"/> or <hi>Assyrians.</hi> The mightiest of all these could but kill the body onely. But our Saviour hath delivered us from the assaulters of our soules; the guilt of sinne the curse of God, the treacherie of the flesh, the sorcerie of the world, the sentence of death, the clawes of Satan, and the chawes of hell. All these, not the spillers of our bloud, but the killers of our soules, this <hi>Iesus,</hi> this <hi>Saviour,</hi> hath saved us from them all.</p>
            <p>The world had enveigled our flesh, the flesh had enthralled us to sinne, sinne had enwrapt us in the curse, the curse had adjudged us to death, death had delivered us to Sathan, Sathan had enjayled us in hell. But as old <hi>Zacharie</hi> singeth in his hymne, God hath raised up a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in the house of <hi>David,</hi> that should deliver us from all these enemies.</p>
            <p>The world is a Witch, but not to be feared, our Saviours selfe hath said it, <hi>Ego vici mundum, I have overcome the world.</hi> The pricke of the flesh, his grace hath blunted it. The wound of sinne, his bloud hath sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it. The vigour of the curse, his Crosse hath voided it. The doome of death, his death diverted it. The clawes of Sathan, his bonds have chained them, and the chawes of hell, his thornes have choked them. The world, the great enchanter of the sonnes of men, the sonne of a woman hath undone his spells. The flesh the false betraier of them that foster it, the Lord was made flesh, for to chasten it. Whom sinne like a fierie Serpent did <hi>perimere,</hi> them Christ like the brasen Serpent did <hi>redimere.</hi> Gods curse had adjudged us to condemnation, but wee have escaped it by Christs Incarnation. Death was entombed, when the Lord was enwombed. Sathan the roarer, is tied up from hurting, with Christs navell sting. And hell the devourer is choaked with his swad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling cloutes.</p>
            <p>To shut up this point, which I should further prosecute, because it is the principallest point of all my text, but that I have handled it here at other times; there is borne this day a Saviour. The Apostle telleth us, that the comming of Christ was of purpose for to save, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. Yea our Saviours selfe tells us so, <hi>that the Sonne of man came to save that was lost. Cain,</hi> the mans first borne sonne was the slayer of his brother, but Christ the womans first borne sonne was the Saviour of his brethren; both the <hi>true Saviour, Ioh.</hi> 4. 42. and <hi>the onely Saviour, Esay</hi> 43. 11. and Saint <hi>Peter</hi> saith the same, <hi>Acts 4. 12. non est nomen aliud, there is no other name under heaven by which we may be saved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next point in my Text, is the Messias-ship, <hi>which is Christ;</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> was his Christen name, a <hi>Saviour,</hi> that is <hi>Iesus,</hi> and this is his sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name. If you aske, what it doth signifie; Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> doth answer you; <hi>Quis nescit Christum ab unctione appellari?</hi> Who knoweth not that Christ hath his name of anointing? As Kings in times past were anointed by the Priests, by the powring on of the holy oyle; so was our Saviour Christ anointed by God, by the spirituall infusion of the holy Ghost. The former name was of his person; this is of his Office; for the function whereof his Father hath anointed him. That Office is<note place="margin">α. β. γ.</note> three fold; three honourable callings haue surnamed Christ, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, Priesthood, and Prophesie; all three accustomed by record of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:173124:32"/> Scriptures to be consecrated with holy unction: <hi>Saul, David,</hi> and <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> were anointed Kings; <hi>Aaron</hi> and his sonnes were anointed Priests, and <hi>Elias</hi> was commanded to anoint <hi>Elisha</hi> to be Prophet in his roome. And therefore <hi>Iesus,</hi> in whom those callings did concurre all three, might well be called <hi>Christ, i.</hi> the anointed. In regard of which three Offices, that Epithere of <hi>Trismegistus</hi> conferred upon <hi>Mercury,</hi> may be transferred unto Christ, for the very same reasons, for which they ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him so; a great King, a great Priest, and a great Prophet.</p>
            <p>For the first, the assertion of his Kingdome, the Scriptures doe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe it with a cloud of witnesses; I will not presse them in particular, because it is a point also, which I have handled heretofore. Both Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and People; both Iewes and Gentiles, (for the wise men of the East did him homage in that name) both men and Angells, (for it is in <hi>Gabriels</hi> message unto <hi>Mary</hi>) Yea Christ himselfe confessed it, <hi>Marke</hi> 14. 62. and his Father confirmed it, <hi>Psal. 2. 6. Herod</hi> was affraid of it, and therefore made a massacre of all the infants about <hi>Bethleem. Pilate</hi> an Infidell wrote it on the Crosse; and the seale of a <hi>Caesar</hi> upon his grave-stone might argue that a King lay buried under it. If Christ be a King; then what is his Kingdome? It is not like to Kingdomes upon earth; As he said of his peace, <hi>Ioh. 14. Not as the world giveth, give I unto you;</hi> so may he say of his crowne, not as the world ruleth, rule I over you. His Kingdome is spirituall. Mens bodies and their goods, the Kings of the Nations have dominion over them; but <hi>non sic erit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vos,</hi> it was not so with him; Christ onely craveth the subjection of our soules. His entire regiment is in our hearts, by the rule of his Word, and the scepter of his Spirit. The one containes his Will, and bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth us to doe it; the other conveighs his grace, and aideth us to doe it.</p>
            <p>For the second, Christs Priesthood; the Apostle avoucheth it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. Nay God himselfe averteth it, and that with an oath, <hi>Heb. 7. 21. Thou art a Priest for ever after the order of Melchisedek.</hi> A little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible unto us, but acceptable unto Christ, a little despicable in the mouthes of irreligious and prophane men, but honourable in the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the onely wise God. The function of this Priesthood con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth in that sacrifice, which our Saviour was to offer once for all unto his Father on the altar of the Crosse in the shedding of his bloud for the redemption of the world.</p>
            <p>For the third, Christ was a Prophet; the two Disciples call him so, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 19. Yea all the people call him so, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. 11. neither bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Prophet, but a great Prophet, <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 16. so great, that <hi>Iohn the Baptist,</hi> who was more than a Prophet, who was the greatest among all the sonnes of women, thought himselfe unworthy, (not as we speake in proverbe) to beare his bookes, but to beare his shooes, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 11. The Office of his Prophesie himselfe expoundeth wherein it say, <hi>Esay</hi> 61. 1. The Lord, saith he, anointed me, and his Spirit is upon me to preach good tidings unto the poore, to bind up the broken hearted, and to proclaime libertie to the captives, and enlargement to the prisoners.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Which is Christ the Lord</hi>] As there be many Antichrists, but one
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:173124:33"/> is the Antichrist; so are there many Christs, but <hi>Iesus</hi> is the Christ. Here is indeede no article, for some Grammaticall reason; but through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the Gospells he is called <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. All Kings are Christs; for they have their kinde of unction; <hi>Cyrus</hi> himselfe albeit a heathen King, yet is called Christ, for his anointing royall, <hi>Esay</hi> 45. 1. All Gods people are Christs, <hi>Psal. 105. 15. Touch not mine anointed.</hi> But <hi>Iesus</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is called Christ, because God hath anointed him farre above his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, <hi>Psal.</hi> 45. not onely <hi>abundanter,</hi> but also <hi>redundanter;</hi> not onely above his fellowes, but also for his fellowes. For as the Apostle speaketh, wee all have received of his fulnesse. As <hi>Aarons</hi> ointment dropped downe unto his skirts, <hi>Psal.</hi> 133. so hath the oyle of Christs anointing distilled downe to all his members, over whom, as <hi>Boaz</hi> did on <hi>Ruth,</hi> so he hath spread the skirt of his garment.</p>
            <p>This sacred surname of the Sonne of God, is all one with <hi>Messias,</hi> but that the one is Hebrew, and the other Greeke. The Evangelist so expoundeth it <hi>Iohn 1. 41. We have found the Messias, that is by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, the Christ.</hi> The particular proofes that this was the <hi>Messi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</hi> by Prophesies, by Witnesses, by his Miracles, his Sufferings, and Foretellings; I am forst to pretermit, and to proceed unto the next point.</p>
            <p>The sixth point in this Scripture, is the Divinity of this Infant; which is Christ the Lord. It is the argument which our Saviour used himselfe, <hi>Math.</hi> 22. 44. to force from the Pharisees the confession of his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head. They thought the <hi>Messias</hi> should be a meere man. But Christ did urge this terme, to proove he should be God; because <hi>David</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him Lord. And therefore <hi>Thomas</hi> conjoyneth them <hi>Iohn 20. 28. My Lord, and my God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Word by taking flesh became the Sonne of Man; but he did not therefore cease to be the Sonne of God. <hi>In formam servi transijsse, non est naturam Dei perdidisse, Hilar.</hi> His Incarnation <hi>nihil contulit, nihil abstulit,</hi> saith <hi>Leo,</hi> as it put nothing to, so it tooke nothing from the nature of his Godhead. Though he did <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, though he did fill his mothers wombe; yet he did not <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, empty his Fathers bosome, <hi>Basil. Forma servi accessit, non forma Dei recessit, August.</hi> Hee tooke unto him the substance of man; but he put not from him the Essence of God.</p>
            <p>The greatnesse of Gods wrath, which was to be appeased, the sharpenesse of the curse, which was to be endured, and the hardnesse of the Law, which was to be observed, required the <hi>Messias</hi> to be more then a man. That God might be satisfied, and man might be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified, the mediatour that must goe betweene them both, must bee both God and man. Our Ghostly enemies, the devill, death, and hell, could not be conquered, by a Creature. As he must be man, that should encounter them; so he must be God, that could discomfit them? So he must, and so he was; God as well as man; and therefore called <hi>Immanuel,</hi> that is, <hi>God with us,</hi> God and man both together in one Person.</p>
            <p>Sundry sorts of Heretickes thought him <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a meere and bare man; but the Apostle telleth us, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. Deus erat in Christo,</hi>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:173124:33"/> there was a God in Christ. That Godhead appeared, though covert in the flesh, yet overt in his actions; he declared his Divinity both <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, saith the Evangelist, both <hi>miraculis &amp; oraculis, Tertul.</hi> both by his Doctrine, and Miracles. <hi>Never man spake as he spake, Iohn 7. 46. Never man d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d as he did, Math.</hi> 9. 33.</p>
            <p>The time doth cut me off; there have beene many Christs; as our Saviour speaketh in an other sense, behold here is Christ, behold there is Christ; but this Infant onely was the Lord Christ. He is called a little after, <hi>ver. 26. The Lords Christ;</hi> but here <hi>Christ the Lord.</hi> Every King is the Lords Christ, that is, the Lords anointed. <hi>David</hi> cals <hi>Saul</hi> so, 1 <hi>Sam. 24. Abishai</hi> cals <hi>David</hi> so, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19. But here is, not <hi>Christus Domini,</hi> but <hi>Christus Dominus,</hi> not the Lords Christ, but Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe the Lord.</p>
            <p>The last thing in my Text, is the place of Christs Nativity, <hi>the City of David.</hi> The first of <hi>Sion</hi> was called <hi>Davids</hi> City, because by him the <hi>Iebusites</hi> were ejected thence. And <hi>Bethleem</hi> also is called <hi>Davids</hi> citie, because he was borne there. The Angell meanes not <hi>Sion;</hi> it was the citie of the great King, <hi>Psal.</hi> 48. but he meaneth <hi>Bethleem;</hi> it is the citie of this little King. He might have said expresly, In the towne of <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leem;</hi> but it pleased him rather to use this circuition; <hi>In the citie of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid;</hi> because Christ came from <hi>David;</hi> because the child now borne was not onely of his citie, but also of his seed. It was perversnesse in the people, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7. 27. and they spake against their conscience, when they said <hi>Nemo scit, unde sit,</hi> no man should know, whence the Messias was. For the Prophets had foretold it, that there he should be borne; and the Pharisees confessed it, when <hi>Herod</hi> made enquirie of the place of Christs birth.</p>
            <p>May I not say of <hi>Bethleem,</hi> that which <hi>Lot</hi> said of <hi>Zoar, an non modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca est? Is it not a little one?</hi> Yet now is little <hi>Bethleem</hi> made peere to great <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> it is the citie of God. <hi>Bethleem</hi> lately called the citie of <hi>David,</hi> is now become the citie of the sonne of <hi>David.</hi> In <hi>Bethleem the least among the thousands of Iuda,</hi> is borne this day the greatest among the Princes of <hi>Iuda.</hi> For out of it is sprung <hi>Dominator in Israel;</hi> a Lord in <hi>Israel;</hi> nay the King of <hi>Israel,</hi> as <hi>Nathanael</hi> called him; <hi>whose goings forth are from everlasting.</hi> Vnto this little <hi>Bethleemite,</hi> a little Infant, but a great God, the <hi>Saviour</hi> of <hi>Israel, which is Christ the Lord, together with God the Father, &amp;c.</hi>

I reade it thus, <hi>Glory be on high to God, and in earth peace, to men of good will.</hi> It is an holy Antheme, sung by a quire of Angels, at Christs Nativity: a song of three parts, one of <hi>Glory,</hi> one of <hi>Peace,</hi> and one of <hi>Grace.

               </gap> in both, light in them both to lead us to Gods glory. But Christ, the Word, by which he made them both, to whom he gave them both, by whom he reconciled them both, his Incarnation in Gods Predestination, was the mainest meanes, intended to that end. Gods justice gaines him glory; his mercy then much more. If God have glory in sinners condemnation, how much more hath he it in Christs Incarnation, the Mediatour of all mercy? Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in his compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son gives greater glory to the Gospell, then the Law: and as to Kings on earth, so even to God in Heaven, it is more glorious to be mercifull, then just. God gets more Glory <hi>Condonando,</hi> then <hi>Condemnando,</hi> by saving sinners, then by damning them: and Christs comming in the flesh was of purpose to save sinners.</p>
            <p>Had God but saved man onely, and not sent Christ; for that hee could have done, had he so pleased, had he so cast it in his eternall counsell, he had gained Glory so. But to send his Sonne from his owne side, his Sonne, God like himselfe; to take our nature, so to be fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to suffer for our sinnes, it is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> termeth it; this mercy merits glory above mans conceipt. God, that he might save man, to be made man, to disparage his high Deity by assuming our base substance, to lye nine moneths in a womans wombe, to be bred of her, to be fed of her, borne of her body, and nourisht at her brests; this glory unto God is more then <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

And where is it fitter, glory should be sung, to the Father for the Sonne, then in <hi>excelsis,</hi> there where the Father is, and whence he sent his Sonne, that is, on high: Where should be sung <hi>Hosannah</hi> to the Sonne of <hi>David,</hi> but <hi>in excelsis, Hosan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah in the highest?</hi> It is meet and right, that glory be to God on high, whose Sonne, as sings old <hi>Zachary, visits us from on high.</hi> The hight of his mercy merits hight of praise; praise, as in the hundreth eight and fortieth <hi>Psalme,</hi> first in the generall, from the Heavens: then praise in the particular, from the holy Angels, and the whole army of the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Spirits; praise from the Sunne and Moone, and all the Sarres of light, praise from the Heaven of Heavens, and the waters above the Heavens. But especially from all the holy orders of the Angels, Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubs and Archangels, Seraphims and Thrones, Powers, and Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, all to sing joyntly, as in the <hi>Revelation.</hi> Power and Salvation, glory and honour to the Lord our God.</p>
            <p>There are many songes of men recorded in the Scriptures; <hi>Deborahs</hi> and <hi>Moses, Davids</hi> and others in the old Testament; <hi>Zacharies</hi> and <hi>Maries;</hi> and old <hi>Simeons</hi> in the New.

            <p>The profit of Christs Birth abounds unto the creature; but the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of it, rebounds backe to God.

               </gap>, both in word and deed: the glory of them both reflected upon God. Both his oraculous doctrine, and his miraculous workes procured God praise. The hearers and beholders both <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

And who should have the glory of the things of God, but God? Christ is Gods Saving-health: mine eyes have seene (saith <hi>Simeon) Salutare tuum,</hi> thy Salvation. And who should have the glory? Who saving God, for Gods Saving-health?</p>
            <pb n="60" facs="tcp:173124:36"/>
            <p>The whole Oeconomie of salvation was plotted by Gods selfe, when as yet there was nothing existent, but Gods selfe; <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, saith the Apostle before the world was founded. Man was not then, Angells were not then, to consult with him, to resolve with him. And therefore men and Angells, both must sing with <hi>David, Non nobis domine, non nobis, Not unto us O Lord, not unto us, but give the glory to thy name.</hi> The action solely and meerely was by God; and therefore the glorie must also wholly and sheerely be to God. Peace impious Papist, that pressest thy proud merits, to pull some part of glory sacrilegiously to thee. The Angells, who knew better whose it is, then thou, doe give it unto God. It is indeed Gods due in all things whatsoever. But in Christs Incarnation, and the consequents thereof, all Christians will confesse, it is Gods meere proprietie. For Christ is Gods; and it is Christs owne rule, <hi>Quae Caesaris, da Caesari, quae Dei, Deo;</hi> that which is <hi>Caesars,</hi> must be given to him; so what is Gods, give it unto him. <hi>Glory be to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second part is like unto the first, both for the number and nature of the termes, to which they have exact correspondence. There was glorie, here is peace; that on high, this on earth; that to God, this to men. The Babe that at this time was borne both God and man, his birth was behoovefull both to God and man: to the one it brought <hi>Glorie,</hi> to the other <hi>Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Authors of this antheme in the verse before my Text, are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>heavenly Souldiers.</hi> A song of peace, how may it sute with souldiers? The shepheards might have ask'd them, as <hi>Iehu</hi> did <hi>Iehoram, quid vobis &amp; paci;</hi> what have you to doe with peace? The Physitian he arkens after the sicke: his wealth comes not by health. So the souldiers wish is warre. But the phrase lookes not at the matter of the message, but by circumlocution onely meanes the Angels: who otherwhere are sent for Sword, for Fire, for Pestilence; but here for peace. As a King for joy at the birth of a Sonne, sends forth his proclamations of enlargement to the prisoners, and pardon to the delinquents: so here at Christs▪ Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivitie, Gods heavenly Heraulds proclaime peace to men. For <hi>puer natus est nobis,</hi> saith the Prophet <hi>Esay, A child is borne,</hi> who is the <hi>Prince of peace;</hi> and his comming in the flesh, is of purpose to bring peace.</p>
            <p>But how then saith our Saviour, <hi>thinke not, that I am come to send peace into the world?</hi> Yea, and saith not <hi>Iob</hi> also <hi>militia est vita hominis, mans life on earth is a perpetuall warfare?</hi> Christ forbids us to thinke, he sent peace into the world; but by it he meant peace towards the world. For the profession of Christ hath made the world our enemie. But this peace is not the worlds peace, but Gods. The Apostle so calls it in the fourth to the <hi>Philippians, The peace of God.</hi> And so mans life indeed is a continuall warfare. But that warre is with the World, with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, and the Flesh. Wee warre with them, but wee are at peace with God. Christs Church on earth is called <hi>the militant Church, i.</hi> the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faring Church. Those three are Christs enemies; they are the <hi>Dragon and his Angells. Michael, i.</hi> Christ, <hi>and his Angels, i.</hi> Christians must fight continually against those enemies. That warre is no barre to this peace in my Text, which is of conscience towards God. Nay, rather
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:173124:36"/> this peace is preserved by that warre, and cannot be, where it is not.</p>
            <p>God was mans enemie; Sinne had made him so. He had incurred the curse, and was thrall to Death, to Sathan, and to Hell. Christs Incarnation wrought reconciliation. God was displeased with man; but hee is appeased in Christ. Sinne had so incensed him, that hee swore in his wrath, that wee should not enter into his rest. But God was made man, to mediate betweene both; and his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession hath procur'd us peace. The curse, the Hearault of Gods defiance, Christ hath cancel'd it. Sinne, the cause of Gods dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure Christ hath purged it. Death, the first wound, that God had given us, Christ hath cured it. Hell, the Iayle, to which God had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged us, Christ hath broken it; and Sathan, the Executioner, whom God had set to torture us, Christ hath chained him. God looking on us in his Sonne, is well pleased with us for his sake; His flesh hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored us unto his favour, and that is this peace. Peace hath many species; but this is Gods pardon and reconciliation.</p>
            <p>God and man, sinne had disjoyned them; but Christ hath attoned them: and the attonement is this peace. Christs righteousnesse recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red what mans wickednesse had lost, to wit, Gods love, the companion of this peace. <hi>Righteousnesse and Peace,</hi> saith the <hi>Psalmist, kisse each other.</hi> Christ is them both; <hi>our righteousnesse, 1 Cor. 1. 30. our peace, Eph.</hi> 2. 14. and is therefore paralleld by S. <hi>Paul</hi> unto <hi>Melchisedech, i.</hi> the King of righteousnesse, who was the King of <hi>Salem,</hi> that is the King of peace. To end this, Christ said the <hi>Peacemakers, Mat. 5. shall be called the Sonnes of God;</hi> but here the Peacemaker is the Son of God. Christ saith himselfe, that we have peace in him. And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> seconds him, that our peace with God, is through Christ our Lord. This peace (I said) meanes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation; and Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> saith of Christ, that he is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>the recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation;</hi> hee is the propitiation for our sinnes. Christs comming downe to earth, is for bringing peace on earth; the next terme in my Text.</p>
            <p>There was peace before in heaven: for how should there be enmitie? Was it betweene the persons of the Godhead? As <hi>Paul</hi> said of Christ, <hi>Is Christ divided?</hi> So I may say of God, is God divided? Could schisme be in the Deitie, enmity in the Trinitie? Christ saith of two of them, <hi>Ego &amp; Pater unum sumus;</hi> the Father and the Sonne, were one. And Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> saith of all three; <hi>the Father, the Word, and the holy Ghost, they all are one.</hi> Was it betweene God and the Angels? Those of them that rebel'd, God cast them downe; and grace preserved the rest from like presumption. They all continually waite on God: they all continually have peace with God. Was it betweene themselves? Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> writes of a battell fought in heaven, betweene <hi>Michael</hi> and his Angells, and the <hi>Dragon</hi> and his Angells. But that is but an Allegorie. Was it betweene the Saints? First, it is a question, whether the Saints were there before Christs time. The current of the Fathers runnes to the negative part, that none came there before Christs resurrection; that <hi>Sanguis Christi</hi> was <hi>clavis paradisi;</hi> that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven was shut, till Christs bloud opened it. I will not determine it; I
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:173124:37"/> will onely say; wheresoever they were, they were in blisse. But say, the Saints were there: they were at peace, both betweene themselves, and with Angels, and with God. Heaven hath no hostility: where should be peace, if not in Paradise? The peace then here proclamed by the Angels, it is on earth.</p>
            <p>There is no peace in Hell; neither to the ghosts of men betweene themselves; nor to the spirits of feinds betweene themselves; nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the ghosts and feinds; and least of all betweene them and God. The damned ghosts doe curse, every one his fellow, for suffering, for entising, for assisting him in sinne. The cursed fiends doe rage every one with other, for being his ringleader in rebelling against God. The Ghosts doe gnash at the devils, for tormenting them; and both blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme God for condemning them. Said Christ he came not to bring peace unto the earth; surely he was not sent to bring peace to Hell. The Peace is there, whether now Christs selfe was come. The descending of Gods Son to us, is for the sending of Gods peace to us; and that is the next terme in my Text <hi>Hominibus</hi> to men; <hi>Peace on earth to Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Man was Gods enemy, the Apostle cals him so, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 10. Not as he is man; but sinne had made him so. Gods selfe made man, who hateth nothing that he made. But sinne, the devils creature, who is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy unto God, made man his enemy too. Man had transgrest, and Iustice had sentenced him; and for the execution, there was ordained death, and hell, and sathan, and the evill day. But Mercy had metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a meanes of reconcilement; and Christ would be incarnate, to procure him peace. Man was so pretious in the eyes of God, that his Sonne should suffer, rather then he starve. God would rather die, then man not live.</p>
            <p>The Angels that apostated from their first state, Creatures more glorious farre then man, God instantly damned them. They have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured his doome many thousand yeares: he makes no peace with them, he takes no truce with them. The Origenists, and Mahomet, and some Anabaptists hold, that Lucifer at last shall be loosed from his bands, and restored to his light, he and all the damned fiends. But Saint <hi>Iude</hi> assureth them, that their darkenesse is eternall, and their chaines are everlasting. But man of Gods great mercy hath found a Mediatour; and Gods owne Son owne selfe hath purchased him peace. <hi>Lord, what is man, that thou regardest him? what is the Sonne of man, that thou</hi> the Sonne of God <hi>vouchsafest to visit him? Thou hast made him,</hi> not <hi>little lower,</hi> but much higher, <hi>then the Angels,</hi> and proclamest peace, not in hell to them; but in earth to him; <hi>peace in earth to men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And why to <hi>Men?</hi> why not to devils too? Respects God persons? Is he not rich to all? and said you not before, that his mercies are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all his workes? First, for the Objections; had God sent peace to them, and not to us; God should have seemed so rather to have res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected persons, in receiving to his grace the more excellent creature; and refusing the inferiour. And the Text is true, that <hi>God is rich to all.</hi> But you take not all the Text; <hi>God is rich</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>to all that call on him;</hi> which the devils can not doe. And for Gods mercies, they are over all his workes; misconster not the termes. The prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:173124:37"/>
               <hi>Super</hi> is not extensive, but comparative. His mercies are not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all his workes, but above all his workes; they excell his other workes. Or say it have your sense; Gods mercies so are over all his workes, even over the Angels, as I showed before. For that the good Angels fall not as the bad, that is Gods mercy. Stretch not the Text unto the devils too: Mercy, Gods mercy is over all his workes; All generally, not personally; all <hi>in Specie;</hi> not <hi>in Individuo;</hi> not over every severall creature, but over every kind of worke: as peace is in my Text to Men; but not to all, but to men of good will. Nay; I will not care to yeeld it, in what sense you will. Let all meane individuals. I say, Gods mercy is on the devils too, and on all the damned Spirits. For they all are punisht short of their deserts. God hath mixt mercy with justice even in hell.</p>
            <p>Now for the point, why peace is not to fiends, as well as men; the question is curious; and it might suffice to answer you, as the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees did <hi>Iudas, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, What is that to us?</hi> Yet some writers yeeld these reasons. First, the guilt of Angels was greater then of Man. For they sinned of themselves, but Man by their temptation. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, they fell not all: but all mankind fell. All were in <hi>Adams</hi> loines, when he transgrest. And falling all, they needed a redeemer: it seeming pity in Gods gracious eye, that so noble a Creature should totally be lost. Thirdly, <hi>Adam</hi> slipt of ignorance, and <hi>Eve</hi> of weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; which are but trespasses against God the Father, and the Sonne: But the Angels fell of malice. and so they sinning against God the Holy Ghost, could not be pardoned. To end this point, I will praise God, for sending peace to me; I will not pose God, why he sent not unto them. Even so Lord, because it pleased thee: thou wilt have mercy, on whom thou wilt have mercy, not on Angels, but on men; and not on all them neither, but <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, upon men of good will; which is the last point in my Text; I will be short in it.</p>
            <p>
               <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, I said before, this terme might be taken in two senses; active, to be meant of men, embracing Christ; passive, to be meant of God affecting men. For the first; the peace is unto men, but to men of good will, that willingly and cheerefully receive him for their Saviour. <hi>Herod</hi> was troubled, and all <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> there was no peace to them. Their will was ill, not good to Christ; with a good will they would have murthred him.</p>
            <p>Hence would the Papists strengthen their free will. Their good will to that, you may see in the <hi>Rhemes</hi> Testament. But they are confuted by the learnedst of themselves, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Maldonat;</hi> who both appropriate <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> unto God, and deny it ever to be said of men.</p>

               </gap> wrath, of election; of perdition; so heere <hi>Hominibus bonae voluntatis, to men of Gods good will,</hi> that is, to men, who God of his good will, or as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> phraseth it, in the good pleasure of his will, hath purposed to his Salvation; to them is this peace; sent not of mans deserving, but of Gods vouchsafing. This peace (Saint <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose</hi> telles thee) is not <hi>meriti;</hi> it is not <hi>debiti;</hi> but it is <hi>placiti.</hi> God is pleased to send it them, with whom in Christ he is well pleased;

               <hi>hominibus beneplaciti,</hi> not to men of merit, but to men of grace; and therefore this peace pertaines to them alone, with whom he is well pleased: to men of good will, (an exoticke phrase, and therefore harsh,) to men vouchsafed grace of Gods free favour, and the good pleasure of his holy will. Our Saviour, who was <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, as Saint <hi>Luke</hi> writes of him, a great man against this great mysterie. The mysterie is, that God should be made flesh. Sathan himselfe doubted, whether Christ were God; there's a <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, that it was without contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie, for all this. Examine his owne age.</p>
            <p>What thought the Iewes, when they cried, <hi>Crucifige? Caiphas,</hi> when he rent his cloathes? <hi>Pilat</hi> would not have sentenced him, nor the Elders have delivered him, had they thought, that as (Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith) <hi>Deus erat in Christo.</hi> Christ had beene a person compound of man and God. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith it, <hi>Had they knowne it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.</hi> But their conceit of him was but as of a man. <hi>Come see a man,</hi> saith the <hi>Samaritane</hi> woman. <hi>Ecce homo,</hi> saith <hi>Pilat, Behold the man.

            <p>But <hi>distingue tempora,</hi> consider Person, Time, and Place; Tis no <hi>Hyperbole.</hi> It was harsh to Heathens, and to Iewes sometimes, and out of <hi>Israel.</hi> But to Christians now in the Church, this sacred secret was without controversie. Nor must Saint <hi>Paul, praestare culpam,</hi> make good all translations. The <hi>Hyperbole</hi> is not Saint <hi>Pauls;</hi> it is the Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, if it be one. S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith but <hi>ex confesso,</hi> the Greeke word meanes no more. That's no peremptory terme. I said, it was a mood: and it is a modest mood and moderate. Say, the great mystery of Christs In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation were contradicted by all without, were controverted by some within the Church: Yet those, that were converted, did confesse it all. Whence sprung that horrible Title of confessours, frequent in the Church.</p>
            <p>A checke to after ages, to the degenerate generations of Atheising, Heathenising, Sathanising Christians. Wee pardon <hi>Lucian,</hi> a profest Atheist. What should Christ looke for of him, but scoffes. It was he, cald Christ <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the crucified Sophister. And so we doe <hi>Liba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius;</hi> It was he that askt, what that Carpenters sonne was doing then in heaven. Be Christ a Galilean, and the Gospell <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

He was an <hi>Apostata.</hi> And <hi>Felix</hi> his Treasurer may make up the the messe; See, what plate <hi>Maries</hi> sonne is served with, it was his Apophthegme. But that Christians should question, should quarell this mysterie; thats to me a mysterie. Some his Godhead, some his flesh, as did sundrie sorts of Heretickes. Nay, that Popes Christs owne Vicars, should denie their Lord, like <hi>Peter; Peters</hi> suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours in nothing but in that; should mocke at this mysterie, this my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie of godlinesse, it were strange, were not <hi>Babylon</hi> a mysterie her selfe. Her brazed brow is branded with that marke, <hi>Apoc 17. Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium,</hi> a mysterie, the mysterie of ungodlinesse. Nay some Papists have confest, they have seene the word <hi>Mysterium,</hi> engraven closely in the Popes Diademe. See <hi>Iames Bastardie</hi> of Fathers in his Epistle Dedicato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. Saith not <hi>Socrates,</hi> that <hi>Felix</hi> the second was an <hi>Arian?</hi> Then thought hee not Christ God. Christ to be God incarnate, it seemes <hi>Leo▪</hi> the tenth thought it not <hi>Magnum Mysterium,</hi> but <hi>magnum menda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium,</hi> not a mysterie, but a sophistrie; <hi>Illa fabula de Christo,</hi> he termes the Gospell but a meere fable. The like blasphemie was that of <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie</hi> the ninth, that reckoned three famous Impostors of the world, <hi>Moses, Mahomet,</hi> and <hi>Christ.</hi> A title fit to be put into the stile of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of Rome. They are indeed Impostors; and so <hi>Machiavel</hi> calls one of them, <hi>Alexander</hi> the sixth, the Impostor of the world. He that inscribed his Booke to the now Pope, <hi>Paulo</hi> V. <hi>Vicedeo;</hi> either meant some mysterie, or he must mend the title. For how can his Holinesse be justly called Vice-God, if Christ, whose Vicar hee is, be not God? Enough of the Moode; come to the Mysterie.</p>
            <p>It is fit <hi>quid</hi> goe before <hi>quantum. Rhemists</hi> read this Scripture, great is the Sacrament. Wee must pardon their superstition. The vulgar Latine hath <hi>Sacramentum,</hi> and the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> ties them to that Translation. Christs Incarnation is a mysterie. It is not <hi>Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> onely: that's too low a word for so high a thing. <hi>Holy</hi> secrets are called mysteryes. The Gospell in generall is a mysterie. Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:173124:40"/> calls it so, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 26. The Church long governed by God under Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, under darke types and shadowes. The project of it too, a myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; that the whole world estranged from God, should be cald by it to the hope of salvation, and eternall life offered unto all. God was before knowne onely in <hi>Israel.</hi> Nay all our Preaching is mostly mysterie. Gods Minister, <hi>loquitur mysteria,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> most of his speech is of mysticall matter, crosse to the common conceit of men, meere pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radoxe to carnall eares. Even morall Divinitie is harsh to flesh, absurd sense; to shunne pleasure, love our enemies, renounce the world. But the things of Faith, they are mystery indeed. And so S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls them in the 9. <hi>verse</hi> of this <hi>Chapter, mysterium fidei.</hi> The mystery of faith, of Christ, of the Gospel, of Gods <hi>beneplacitum,</hi> the Apostles termes too. Of heaven, of Gods Kingdome, the termes of the Evangelists; these are right mysteries.</p>
            <p>The things of Christ are secrets all; his whole Historie is mysterie; his Life, his Passion, not his Incarnation onely. But yet his Incarnation most, and meant here specially. A secret <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, and <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, made knowne and manifest. Vtterly hid from Heathens; very darkely shewed to Gods owne people. <hi>Abraham desired to see it,</hi> Christ saith, Angells de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired to see it, Saint <hi>Peter</hi> saith, <hi>Abraham the friend of God,</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells the Sonnes of God: but neither could. Christ saith, <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> did: but it was but with the eyes of faith. Angells them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves could not see it otherwise. Tis said here, it was seene of Angells. But that was after Christ was borne. See him they did not, see him they could not, in the flesh, till hee had assumed the flesh. The Prophets foresaw him, <hi>praeviderunt, Cassianus</hi> saith, foresaw him in the Spirit. But <hi>they saw him not, non viderunt,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Daniel</hi> saw him more plainely; he was <hi>vir desideriorum,</hi> belov'd of God more specially. And yet he saw him but in vision neither, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. Nay not <hi>Abraham</hi> onely, but many other holy men, many Prophets and just men (saith Christ) desired to see him. <hi>Esay</hi> did; <hi>Oh that thou wouldst breake the heavens, and come downe. David</hi> did; <hi>Bow the heavens, O Lord, and come downe. Moses</hi> did, <hi>Lord shew me thy glory.</hi> But <hi>non vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derunt,</hi> saith our Saviour, they have all desired to see, but <hi>have not seene him.</hi> And yet denie I will not, I may not, that <hi>Abraham</hi> saw Christ in body, in the flesh. For of the three strangers, whom he entertain'd under the Oake at <hi>Mamre,</hi> the Fathers say, that one was Christ, that Christ assum'd a body to appeare to him. Yet was not Christ truely man then. Hee united not that body to his Godhead <hi>hypostatic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s,</hi> personally. Christ was but transfigured (tis <hi>Tertullians</hi> terme,) transfigured for a time into mans flesh, that <hi>Abraham</hi> might see him, with whom hee was to speake. It was but a <hi>praeludium</hi> of his Incarnation. Enough of the <hi>quid;</hi> heare now the <hi>quantum;</hi> a great mysterie.</p>
            <p>As all secrets were not mysteries; so all mysteries are not peeres. The Sacraments are mysteries, but in other sense. For the terme hath three acceptions. Religious Ceremonies are called mysteries, both by the Fathers, and Heathen Writers too. Who hath not met with <hi>Cereris
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:173124:40"/> mysteria?</hi> Thats one. An outward signe of inward secret, thats an other. Baptisme and the Lords Supper are mysteries so. Lastly, an holy secret, and so tis taken here, and else where both by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and by our Saviours selfe. The obstinacie of the Iewes, a mystery in this sense, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. The calling of the Gentiles, a mystery, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. The Resurrection, a mystery, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. All these are mysteries too: but this is the grand mystery.</p>
            <p>Nay there are some other called great too. The changes of the Moone, sometimes full, sometimes horned, sometimes halfe, Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> calles <hi>Grande Mysterium.</hi> So is Marriage by our Apostle, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. called a great mystery. But the mysterie there meant, is the very same with this, Christs match with the Church, which is his Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, the next words to my Text. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> so expounds himselfe, lest any might mistake him: <hi>I speake</hi> (saith he) <hi>concerning Christ, and the Church.</hi> Yea the Resurrection, even great Philosophers have thought a great Mystery, a flat impossibility. It was for preaching of it, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was called a Prattler, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. Christs body to be in many places at once, surely that is either <hi>Magnum Mysterium,</hi> or <hi>Magnum mendacium,</hi> a great mystery, or a grand lye. But the Trinity is a mystery, a great mystery, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

            <p>The mysteries in the heathens Religion were ungodly. They had reason to hide them; they were so abominable, so uncleane, that the eare of a Christian would abhorre them.

               </gap>; they were filthy or false all; fabulous or scurrilous. But this of our Saviours is the mystery of godlinesse. It is Righteousnesse in the <hi>Syriacke.</hi> Tis all one. For <hi>Iustitia</hi> is one of Christs attributes in <hi>Ieremie, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

            </p>
            <p>There is <hi>mysterium impietatis, 2 Thess.</hi> 2. It is <hi>Bezaes</hi> Word; or (as we read it) <hi>the mystery of iniquity.</hi> You heard Babylons forehead markt with that mystery, the mystery of <hi>Belial,</hi> of Antichrist, of Hell. Nay nere goe we so farre for it, to mysticall Babylon. Tis neerer home, among our selves. If trades and occupations be rightly called my ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, tis like the stone of Christs Sepulchre, <hi>magnus valdè,</hi> exceeding great is the mystery of iniquity. Nay, examine the mysticall hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies of men, the deepe dissimulations of the most, of all almost <hi>Fidelem quis inveniet?</hi> Where shall you find a sound and single heart? a right <hi>Nathaniel, in whom there is no guile?</hi> Tis like <hi>Iudahs</hi> wickednesse, <hi>Eze. 9. Magna nimis valdè,</hi> too too exceeding great is the mystery of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. I stray now from my Text: tis holy mystery is meant heere; the mystery of godlinesse, <hi>i. e.</hi> Christs Incarnation. I say, <hi>the mystery
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:173124:41"/> of godlinesse▪</hi> is the Historie of Christ, his Birth, his Baptisme, his Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and his death, his Resurrection, and Ascension; every one a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie, <hi>Athanasius</hi> saith, and so doe other Fathers stile them severally. And the Syriacke word signifies <hi>multum</hi> as well as <hi>magnum:</hi> tis not a single secret, but a manifold mysterie. Gods love to man is infinite, infinite in all dimensions, infinitely broad, infinitely long, infinitely deepe. This mysterie containes both the bredth, and the length, and the depth of that love. Christs Incarnation, what curse hath God menaced, but it hath averted it? What blessing hath God promised, but it hath procured it?</p>
            <p>When I say Gods Incarnation, I meane all the concomitants men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned before. First his Birth, thats a mysterie. Not that <hi>Ante Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferum, Psal.</hi> 110. before the world. That secret transcends this. Christ is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, who shall declare that generation? Not that <hi>Aeternitatis</hi> (as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> termes it) from his Father. But this <hi>Infirmitatis,</hi> from his mother, a great mysterie. Worthy of two <hi>Ecces,</hi> as a paire of Heraulds to proclame it. One of the Prophet, <hi>Behold a Virgin shall conceive and beare.</hi> An other of the Angell, <hi>Behold thou shalt conceive and beare.</hi> Birth and conception by a Virgin? Let all the Bookes on earth, Bible and all, match me that mysterie. His Baptisme another; Saint <hi>Austin</hi> calls it so. Baptisme, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the Bath of sinne, what skilled it Christ, who knew no sinne? But many mysteries were meant in it. Christs owne Initiation into his Office. His fulfilling of all righteousnesse. His publishing to the people, who he was, both by the audible voyce of his Father, and the visible descending of the holy Ghost. His sanctifying of the water for our Baptisme. His opening of heaven to the Baptized, and his making of us members of his body. His Death an other. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> saith, there were five wonders in Christs Death. Wonders differ from mysteries. But there were two mysteries. One, that Christ should die. That he should; that he would; that he could. That hee would; a Lyon for a Dogge, <hi>pro vernaculo, pro vermiculo,</hi> Saint <hi>Bernards</hi> words: the Lord of glory for vile man; for his vassalls; for his enemies. That he should; When man had sinned, that God should suffer: God love man so, to give his Sonne for him. That he could; Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, for God to lye, I may, for God to die, is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> impossible. <hi>Ego sum via, veritas, vita;</hi> Christ is life, as well as truth. The Lord of life to suffer death; God to give up the Ghost. The other mysterie exceeds this, that Christ should but die. For a double death is due to sinne. The parting of the soule from the bodie is the first. But the lake of fire, saith Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> in the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> it is the second death. Deepe then is the mysterie that Christ taking on him the discharge of our debt; should but onely die the death of the bodie. But Christ humbled himselfe, <hi>quo inferius non decuit,</hi> no further, then was fit for God. His bloud onely and death wrought our Redemption. Scripture rests there. <hi>Simpla duplae profuit, Augustine.</hi> One death in him, quit two in us. His Resurrection is another: I meane not, that his body went through the grave stone and chamber doore, where the disciples were. That (if true) is a wonder, but no mysterie. But as his death was the mysterie of his paiment of our paine: so his
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:173124:42"/> rising is the mysterie of his raising us to life; and his conquest of the grave, and his triumph over hell. Take his Ascension too; and the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie is his <hi>Arrabo,</hi> our earnest of heaven, and seasin of salvation. In a word, Christs Incarnation, what curse hath God menaced, but it hath averted it? what blessing hath God promised, but it hath procured it?</p>
            <p>To draw unto an end; Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calls the Gospell (for thats here meant by godlinesse, the historie of Christ) he calls it a great myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. <hi>Credat Iudaeus Apella!</hi> Nay the Iew beleeves it not. The world will not, though hee doe. Both the booke that recordeth it, and the Preacher, that proclameth it, and the hearer that beleeveth it, vilified all. For the first, the Scriptures burnt in <hi>Dioclesians</hi> time; Thats not much; he was an Heathen. Burnt and cut too in <hi>Iehejakins</hi> dayes; hee was an <hi>Israelite.</hi> Nay Christians have burnt it: Arians have, and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natists; heretickes, but Christians. Nay Catholicks have, Romane-Catholickes, the English Testament, yea the Latine too: Bishop <hi>Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> Chaplaine cald it his litle pretie Gods Book, and <hi>Gifford</hi> and <hi>Rainolds</hi> said, it containes some things, prophane and Apocryphall.

               </gap>, thats not a mysterie of Pietie, but a revelation of iniquitie. For the Preacher, art thou <hi>Peter?</hi>

But especially to bee received into the heart, to bee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed unto the soule. That is the kindliest embracing of all other; and without which indeede all the other are but vaine. And I will not say, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> meant not so; though I will not say, he did. The true Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexation, is the due Application of the saying to our selves, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth in the last part; to make our selves the sinners, and Christs comming to save us. Enough of the preface; now to the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition.</p>
            <p>In it the first point is the person; tis <hi>Iesus Christ;</hi> two names, the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> one of his Person, the other of his Office. I will not discourse of them; tis not so pertinent; and I have done it heretofore. [Onely observe this, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> parallels the Angell. Hee not names him onely, but yeelds a reason too; the name <hi>Iesus,</hi> thats <hi>a Saviour:</hi> the reason, <hi>he should save his people from their sinnes.</hi> So Saint <hi>Paul</hi> here, not onely names him, but originates his name. <hi>Iesus</hi> his name; his office <hi>to save sinners.</hi> Two names, but one man: seldome so put together by the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelists; by Saint <hi>Marke</hi> but once, never by Saint <hi>Luke;</hi> but in the <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Epistles</hi> infinite times; and that indifferently, sometimes <hi>Christ</hi> first, sometimes <hi>Iesus.</hi> So though the names bee excellent, the former especially, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

For his names are both communicable to others besides him, <hi>Christ</hi> to many, <hi>Iesus</hi> to some. But the act <hi>to save sinners</hi> is proper to him onely.</p>
            <p>Who is it then to whom Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ascribes this wonderfull worke, to <hi>save</hi> the world? Fit, wee aske after him. The people did, the whole City, all <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> when they heard the children crying to Christ, <hi>Hosannah,</hi> that is, save us; cryed <hi>Quis est iste,</hi> who is this? When he but stilled the windes, and calmed the seas, they askt <hi>Quis est iste,</hi> then. <hi>Herod</hi> at the hearth of his ordinary acts, askt <hi>quis est iste, who is this?</hi> But to <hi>save sinners,</hi> as tis here; to stand betweene Gods wrath and man, cancell his curse, conquer death, Sathan and hell; for this, all this, that man must doe, that will save sinners; tis worthy the question, worth the wonder too, <hi>quis est iste, who is this?</hi>

            <p>The world had enveigled our flesh, the flesh had enthralled us to sinne; sinne had enwrapt us in the curse; the curse had adjudged us to death; death had delivered us to Sathan; Sathan had enjayled us in hell; hell had tormented us in Fire.

<pb facs="tcp:173124:45"/> in fine,</hi> that Christs death was indeed ordained, because man would sinne. But his incarnation had beene, though sinne had not beene: this, to bring us to heaven, that to redeeme us from hell.

            <p>But how then saith our Saviour, <hi>venite ad me omnes, come unto me All?</hi> All are cald; but those All, sinners: tis <hi>Omnes,</hi> but <hi>Laborantes, All that are weary,</hi> and loded with their sinnes. Christ calls himselfe a shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd; and all men are his sheepe; But he that strayes not, him Christ seekes not. He saith, <hi>he was not sent, but to the lost sheepe.</hi> Christs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming was to save that onely, which was lost. And as them onely, so them All. All, but take this withall; <hi>Omnes utique poenitentes,</hi> saith Saint <hi>August.</hi> All that repent.

            <p>Shall I end this part with an Apostrophe? Is there any sinner here, in all this Congregation, his soule sinne-sicke (as Christ sayd in another sense) heavie even unto the death? Apply this faithfull saying to thy selfe, <hi>that Iesus Christ came into the world to save thee.</hi> Are thy sinnes great? are they many? are they both? yet art thou but a sinner. One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I hope, thou art sorry, thou art so. Then are they not so great, but Christs merits exceeds them; neither are they so many, but Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies are moe. If Christ will have man to forgive his brother 77. times: surely God will pardon the penitent sinner 77000. times. Thats for the number. And for the greatnesse▪ <hi>Davids</hi> sinne great, murther and adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery. <hi>Peters</hi> greater; he denyed Christ. <hi>Pauls</hi> greater yet; he perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted Christ. Yet none of these despaired. <hi>Si Paulus sanatus; cur ego desperem?

A word of the instance; and I end.</p>
            <p>Two things in it observeable, the person, <hi>Ego;</hi> and the degree, <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</hi> Great is Gods grace in <hi>Paul</hi> in both. First for the person; <hi>Paul</hi> samples sinners in himselfe. When sinne is questioned, whose tongue makes not his master innocent? layes it not on any but himselfe? <hi>Adam</hi> on the woman; <hi>Eve</hi> on the Serpent. Sinne needs must have some sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: One of the three persons, I, thou, or hee, must father it. But of the three, the first is most unwilling, the hardliest hal'd, to say the sinne is
<pb facs="tcp:173124:46"/> his. <hi>Nonne tu es,</hi> saith <hi>Ahab</hi> to <hi>Elias, is it not thou that troublest Israel?</hi> This <hi>Publican,</hi> saith the Pharisee. But where finde you the first per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son? especially in the number singular. You shall reade sometimes, <hi>Peccavimus, Wee</hi> have sinned; that shame is lesse when borne by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. But <hi>Peccavi,</hi> singular, where finde wee that, but forced? Tis rare. Tis often negative; <hi>Non sum,</hi> I am not, saith the Pharisee; and I am Innocent, <hi>Pilate</hi> cryed. It must bee <hi>David, Peter, Paul,</hi> mortified men, must charge themselves. <hi>Ecce ego,</hi> saith <hi>David,</hi> tis <hi>I have sinned. Lord goe from me,</hi> saith <hi>Peter, I am a sinner.</hi> Yea theres one Publican cryes, <hi>Mihi peccatori, O God be mercifull to me a sinner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tis mans fashion, to <hi>hide</hi> sinne, <hi>Iobs</hi> terme: at least to <hi>slide</hi> the blame on others. S. <hi>Paul</hi> will not follow it; the fashion's naught: confesseth ingenuously his owne guiltinesse; to exemplifie sinners, he singles out himselfe.</p>
            <p>For the last terme, the degree; the other showed S. <hi>Pauls</hi> great hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie. But as <hi>David</hi> once sayd, <hi>Etiam vilescam adhuc,</hi> he will be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler yet. The Cardinall number might have served, <hi>Quorum ego unus sum, whereof I am one.</hi> But he saith, <hi>Primus,</hi> first of sinners; not <hi>Tempore,</hi> in order, but <hi>Pondere,</hi> in measure, worst of sinners. <hi>Paul</hi> was not first; <hi>Peter</hi> was his antient: he was <hi>Homo peccator,</hi> a sinner (you heard) too. <hi>David</hi> before him. Many before him. Nay the first man was not the first sinner; <hi>Adam</hi> was not: <hi>Eve</hi> sinned before him. But <hi>Primus, i. Summus,</hi> greatest, <hi>chiefest of sinners.</hi> Man, if he must confesse; yet he will mince his sinne, lessen it at least. <hi>Levicula vitiola lapsuum,</hi> as a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Bishop speakes, all termes diminutive. Tis a fault, not a sinne; if a sinne, a pettie one; if great, yet of infirmitie; if wilfull, yet but once, if often, yet in youth. He will <hi>thinne</hi> his sinne, if he cannot cover it. S. <hi>Paul</hi> doth not; <hi>chiefe</hi> of sinners. The sinnes of others S. <hi>Paul</hi> felt not; their load lay not on him; he felt his owne, thought them heavier then any. A patterne for the precise hypocrite; who straynes other mens faults, though Gnats, swallowes his owne, though Camels: Others are beames, his but Moates. Man should judge of his sinne, as he doth of his Crosse, <hi>Quod quisque patitur, id putat gravissimum,</hi> hold his owne sinnes most hainous; pardon others, judge himselfe. S. <hi>Paul</hi> doth, cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures himselfe, a blasphemer, a persecutour; here the cheefe of sinners, that is, a sinner paramont, the grand, the hainous, the superlative sinner. Not of course by <hi>Hyperbole</hi> in idle elocution; but in that hearty mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, in which he cryes else where, <hi>Infelix ego homo, wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from this body of death?</hi> For the profitable applying of this comfortable Scripture, the Sacrament now serves. Wherein Christ tenders you his blessed blood and body, which he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered on the Crosse for a Sacrifice for sinne. Come unto it chreerefully: but come to it with Faith. Come with Repentance, and in love. And then every one of us, at the taking of the Bread and Wine into his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, even the greatest and hainousest sinner of us all, may say unto his soule, <hi>Iesus Christ came into the world to save me.</hi> The Lord of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, by his holy spirit, lift up your hearts to him, confirme your faith, comfort your spirits, forgive your sinnes, and save your soules, for our Saviours sake, Christ Iesus, <hi>Cui, &amp;c.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Aint <hi>Stevens</hi> Prayer, at his giving up the ghost. A Saints Praier; all are not so; many pray in Scripture; not Saints. <hi>Balaam</hi> did, the Priests of <hi>Baal</hi> did. Many that are in hell, have prayed; many that shall be, pray now, <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> Christ saith. <hi>Steven</hi> heere prayes, a Saint; more; a Martyr. The Church history cals him <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the first Martyr. This day this holy man obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Crowne of martyrdome. He hath his name of it; it signifies a Crowne. His Person I presse not, tis Parergon, My Text is but his Prayer onely, shall be my whole Theme. Not <hi>Quis,</hi> but <hi>Quid;</hi> not Who he is, but What he saith. He praies to Christ, <hi>Lord Iesus;</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends his Soule to him, <hi>Receive my Spirit.</hi> But two particulars, the Person prayed too, <hi>Christ;</hi> the thing prayed for, <hi>Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the first, Prayer is ever prefac't with the Person prayed unto. <hi>O God be mercifull. O Christ, heare us. Lord, have mercy upon us.</hi> Be we never so short in prayer; yet we doe that. Peruse all the prayers in all Christian Liturgies, all the Collects (as we call them) in our booke of Divine Service, the prayers of the Patriarkes, of the Prophets, the Apostles, all other holy men throughout the Booke of God; you shall finde it, to be so. Yea and of unholy too. <hi>O Baal, heare us. O God, I thanke thee.</hi> Christ himselfe did so, <hi>Father, forgive them; Father, if it be possible:</hi> and Pray thus, saith he, <hi>Our Father.</hi> It is fit: our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence to the Person so requires. Make but Petition to a Man; to
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:173124:47"/> speake to him abruptly, were rude, and unmannerly. <hi>O man of God,</hi> saith the Captaine to <hi>Elias.</hi> Not in petition onely, but in all things al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most, compellation is discreet, nay necessary Complement: How shall it else be knowne, to whom I speake? <hi>O King, live for ever. Friend, how camest thou in hither? Woman, great is thy Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The appellation not tyed precisely to be ever the first word. It is sometimes in the middes, sometimes in the end; but chiefely first. In sense first, and by nature howsoever. Onely omit it not; have it some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. A praier without it, is the speech of a mad man. [If I will pray; it must be to some person, to some supposed person at the least. The heathens prayed to their gods. Their gods were not; the Scriptures calles them, not <hi>Elohim,</hi> but <hi>Elihin;</hi> things not existing. Yet they thought them gods, gave them names: nothing hath no name. They were nothing indeed, but in imagination; and what they thought them, that they cald them.]</p>
            <p>The Compellation heere hath two termes, the one common to the whole Trinity, the other proper to Christ; both conjoyned in the new Testament, almost 100. times. For the former, the <hi>Athanasian</hi> Creed bids us beleeve, <hi>That the Father is Lord, the Sonne also is Lord, and so is the Holy Ghost.</hi> It is cald in the booke of <hi>Wised.</hi> 14. 21. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a name incommunicable, he meanes to any Creature; but every Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in the Godhead is called Lord.</p>
            <p>Tis all one with <hi>Iehovah</hi> in the old Testament, a name <hi>Propriissimum, Zanchies</hi> word, most proper to God. But <hi>Cognomen Dei, Tertullian,</hi> Gods surname. None but God is Lord; but whosoever is God, is Lord and therefore <hi>Christ. Thomas</hi> called <hi>Didymus,</hi> that is a twin, cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples them as twins, my Lord, and my God.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Arians</hi> say, <hi>Christ</hi> was not called Lord, before his Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. What brow but brazen would say so? Not once, not thrice onely, not ten times, thrice ten times is Christ cald so before. Indeed an. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell on the stone of the Sepulchre calles him Lord, <hi>Come see the place,</hi> saith he, <hi>where the Lord was laid.</hi> That was after he was risen. But it was his usuall title in every mouth almost before. Christs selfe approoved it, <hi>You call me Lord, and you say well, for so I am.</hi> But I must confesse, that was not in the sense meant by this <hi>Martyr.</hi> The word hath many senses. The people cald Christ so in their reverend conceipt of him, for his doctrine, and his miracles. So <hi>Obadiah,</hi> a great person called <hi>Elias</hi> Lord, a poore Prophet. Very meane men were cald so in Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, A Gardiner was by <hi>Mary,</hi> as she thought. <hi>Abrahams</hi> servant was by <hi>Rebecca.</hi> It is therefore in your English bookes, save of the last tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation, not Lord, but Master oftentimes. Nor Master neither, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time Sir. But Christ is called Lord heere in a higher sense. And haply the <hi>Arians</hi> meant so, that Christ was not cald Lord in the sense heere, before the Resurrection. But that is false too. He was cald so even that morning, he was borne, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 11. and that by an Angell, <hi>Christ the Lord.</hi> Yea in his mothers wombe, <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> cals him <hi>Lord.</hi> So did an other Angell at his Conception, <hi>Dominus tecum.</hi> Nay <hi>David</hi> called him so many hundred yeares before his Incarnation, <hi>Dixit Dominus, Domino meo.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="75" facs="tcp:173124:47"/>
            <p>It is a high title here due to Christ, either as the Word, peere to his Father, God as well as he. Or as the <hi>Messias,</hi> our anointed King, <hi>Heire of all things, Heb.</hi> 1. 2. all things put under him. Or as our Saviour; he bought us with a price, redeemed us with his bloud. [Three Hebrew words, <hi>Iehovah, Adonai, Bagnal,</hi> all signifie Lord, and all belong to Christ. He is <hi>Iehovah,</hi> as he is God; <hi>Adonai,</hi> as he is King; and <hi>Bagnal,</hi> as the Spouse or Husband of the Church. Saint <hi>Steven</hi> in my Text may meane any of all these.] I should chuse the first, the prayer to be prefac't with two words, the one <hi>Potestatis,</hi> of his power, the other <hi>Pietatis,</hi> of his love. Able as the Sonne of God, readie as the sonne of man, to heare and helpe us, our <hi>Lord</hi> to owne us; <hi>Iesus</hi> to save us. Who so fit, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend a Christian soule unto, as he that made it, when it was not, the Lord; as he that sav'd it when it was lost, <hi>Iesus?</hi> Thats the next terme, <hi>Lord Iesus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are many Lords saith <hi>Paul,</hi> there is but one <hi>Iesus.</hi> Doth Saint <hi>Steven,</hi> because the first word is so common, restraine it with the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond? Hee doth not. For thers but one Lord neither in <hi>Stevens</hi> sense. There are many Lords; but there is but one Lord God, <hi>Dominus Deus noster unus, Deut.</hi> 6. 4. But the Persons of the Godhead being three, and this title being common to them all; if <hi>Steven</hi> will pray to one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, he must adde another word to Lord; and so he doth here, <hi>Iesus.</hi> But why it? I answer, why not it? Why might he not pray, as well to God the Sonne, as to the Father, or the holy Ghost? I may direct my prayer to any one of them; tis no wrong to the rest. All three are so entwind, the Father in the Sonne, the Sonne in him, the Spirit in both, both in the Spirit, that when one is worshipped, all three are glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified.</p>
            <p>But yet why <hi>Iesus?</hi> First, why that Person? Then why that Name? For the one, who fitter to be the Receiver of our soules, then who was pleased to be the Redeemer of our soules? All three were cooperants in mans Redemption; but Christ was the maine; Hee was made man for us, he shed his bloud for us. Salvation is of them all, yet by him onely; Hee is our Mediatour, they are not. For the other, the person here prayed unto is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, hath many names; the Word, the Sonne of God, the Sonne of man, Sonne of <hi>David, Christ</hi> or <hi>Messias,</hi> they two are one, <hi>Siloh, Amen, Immanuel;</hi> and here <hi>Iesus.</hi> All save the last are his Appellations rather than his Name. This is his right Name, and (if I may so speake) his Christen name, given him at his Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision, as ours are at our Baptisme. Lord is but Christs <hi>Cognomen,</hi> you heard <hi>Tertullians</hi> terme, but <hi>Iesus</hi> his proper name: Imposed by an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell, by two Angells, to <hi>Marie</hi> by one, to <hi>Ioseph</hi> by another. A name (the Cabalists say) full of mysteries, but many idle, all impertinent. I omit them.</p>
            <p>The Etymon of this name, whether Hebrew, as an Angell in the Gospell hath expounded it, or Greeke, as some Fathers have elegantly fitted it, sheweth the reason why <hi>Steven</hi> useth it. It signifies a Saviour. The stones battered his body, the paines bittered his soule: but the Name of <hi>Iesus</hi> sweetned them. <hi>Oleum effusum, nomen tuum,</hi> that name like precious ointment, soveraine oyle. The stones bruised his bodie,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:173124:48"/> but the Name suppled his soule. <hi>Mel in ore,</hi> saith <hi>Bernard;</hi> It is honie to the mouth: What is it to the soule? Salvation, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the greatest of Gods acts, <hi>Basil.</hi> and <hi>Iesus</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the sweetest of Christs names; <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the mightie God: <hi>Esay</hi> calls him so, but <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the sweet Redeemer, the faithfull find him so. The Martyr couples them, calls him Lord, that is strong; but <hi>Iesus</hi> too, that is, sweete. <hi>Iudahs Lyon</hi> like <hi>Samsons, out of the strong comes sweetnesse. Stevens</hi> corpse is brused and broken, theres no saving it. But his Spirit hath a Saviour, he commends it unto him, <hi>Lord Iesus receive my spirit.</hi> He hath another prayer for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of his persecutors; he cries there but Lord onely. But to cheere and comfort his owne deceasing soule, hee addes a second title in assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of salvation, not onely <hi>Lord,</hi> but <hi>Iesus</hi> too. <hi>Marie</hi> saith, <hi>her spirit rejoyc'd in him,</hi> and <hi>Steven</hi> prayes his spirit to be received by him. Thats the petition; come to it.</p>
            <p>The Petition, like the preface hath two termes too, an Act, and an Object. <hi>Steven</hi> prayes the Lord <hi>Iesus:</hi> What to doe? to <hi>receive.</hi> To receive what? his <hi>Spirit.</hi> Both a Prayer, and a Will. As Christ did to his Father, so doth he to Christ, commends his spirit to him, as a <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest.</hi> But it is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in Prayer-wise, Receive it, a <hi>Request;</hi> a Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Prayer. Suite is made seldome to receive, I meane on his part that is prayed to. All men sue to receive; but from him, they sue unto, not he from them. Petitioners crie, ever <hi>Da,</hi> never <hi>Accipe,</hi> give, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. Speakes <hi>Steven</hi> advisedly? He doth. It is sometimes benefit to the petitioner, that the partie, whom he petitions, doe receive. <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> prayed <hi>Esau</hi> to receive his present. It wonne his love. Princes are prayed in Parliament to receive Subsidies. It is not their private profit, but the peoples; they protect them. <hi>Steven</hi> here prayes Christ to receive his soule, not to profite him, but to save it. Hee saith not <hi>Accipe,</hi> but <hi>Suscipe,</hi> not take it as a gift, but receive it as a charge, as a precious <hi>Depositum.</hi> For so are Saints soules, committe dtoh is trust, to keepe, untill his comming, and then to redeliver them. [Christs soule more precious farre than ours▪ Christ durst commit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Gods hands] The graves receive our bodies, they keepe them bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, suffer them to rot. But Christ is the faithfull Feoffee of our soules; If he receive them, they are safe. <hi>Steven</hi> hath reason, all men have, to petition God to receive so.</p>
            <p>Said I, it was a Legacie? It is. <hi>Steven</hi> is seased on suddenly by the mad multitude, must die, die instantly. Make a Will he cannot, save by word, and that in a word too. Dispose of his temporall state he can not, does what he can; onely bequeaths his spirit to Christ; had beene a disciple, and learned that of his Master, commends his soule to God, breaths it out into Christs bosome. No man needs die Intestate, no Christian, either for lacke of time, or want of state. The barest beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger hath a soule; and the suddenest dier can say with <hi>Steven,</hi> or if not say in word, yet pray in heart, <hi>Lord Iesus receive me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Gods craves the Spirt, <hi>Da mihi, Prov.</hi> 23. But so doth Satan too, as the King of <hi>Sodom</hi> said to <hi>Abraham, Da mihi animas, give me the soules.</hi> Give it thou him, that gave it thee. Soules are not <hi>ex traduce,</hi> from our Parents, but from heaven. Tis God, that gives them, saith the <hi>Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:173124:48"/> Eccles.</hi> 12. 7. give it to God; but in the Martyrs Word, <hi>Receive it;</hi> he praied in faith; not in the Prophets mood, <hi>Take it, Ionas</hi> said so, praied so, but in anger, <hi>Elias</hi> too, but in griefe. Not, <hi>Tolle,</hi> take my Soule; the fiends doe that, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 20. but <hi>Suscipe,</hi> receive it. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theists in desperate imprecation bid the devill take their soules. But Christians in humble supplication, pray God, receive their soules. God thinkes not scorne to be mans Legatary, a giver to him in his life, a receiver from him, at his death. A Legatary not of his lands, or his goods; let him will them to others; but of his soule. Thats the last thing in my Text, <hi>Lord Iesus, receive my Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet first heare the conceipt, the base conceipt of some Christians in <hi>Arabia,</hi> in <hi>Origens</hi> dayes, and queld by him: but revived lately by Anabaptists, that the soule dies with the body, sleepes with it, till judgement. Then it needs no receiver. <hi>Calvin</hi> confuted it, because it spred in his time; I need not, it is dead now. Mens soules are kept, not in <hi>Communi Custodia,</hi> as <hi>Lactantius</hi> writes; thats an errour too: to sequester all soules (<hi>Tertullians</hi> terme) into one place, till the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, good and bad all together. But yet in <hi>Custodia;</hi> that word may have good meaning. Yea <hi>in Communi</hi> too, if construed well; the Saints soules all in safety, the reprobates all in jayle. Papists presse <hi>Promptuaria,</hi> out of Apocryphall <hi>Esdras,</hi> certaine Cels for soules. Nor will we sticke at that. <hi>Esdraes</hi> word is not bad, if not abused, abused to build their buttries of their two <hi>Limbi,</hi> and <hi>Purgatory.</hi> The Fathers have the like, it is <hi>Receptacula,</hi> good too in right sense, and suting with my Text, places of receipt. God receives our soules, holy mens soules. His house hath many mansions, Christ saith; there hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowes them. But they sleepe not there, as those fond Arabians and Anabaptists held, meaning by sleepe, death; but live and sing <hi>Hallelu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah</hi> unto God, to the Lord Iesus, that receiveth them. I pray you marke Christs word there, his Fathers house. Heaven is Gods house; Iust mens soules are there, theres no suspense, but present fruition, not full indeed, because they want their bodies, but happy; fruition of Gods selfe, contemplation of the Trinity, saith <hi>Nazianzen:</hi> are with the King, saith <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> not by faith, as on earth, but <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, face to face; not <hi>in atrio,</hi> as Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> saith, but <hi>in summo coelo,</hi> hard by Gods throne, saith the same Father. Say not, Christ promised the thiefe upon the Crosse, Paradise, not Heaven. For both are one, <hi>Idem</hi> (saith <hi>Theophylact.) est Paradisus &amp; Regnum coelorum.</hi> Tis but <hi>Euthymius</hi> distinguisht Heaven from Paradise, of lightest credit, because the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Father. If neede be, <hi>vide fusius, Bellarm. lib. de Sanctorum Beatitud. cap. 2. 3. 4. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To end this Act; God gives man, every man a soule, lends it him for his life: at his death he must render it. So we doe, all men doe, the man Christ did, <hi>Iohn 19. 30. Tradidit Spiritum,</hi> we give up the Ghost▪ [that some thinke the breath, I thinke the soule] Tis received instant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. God receives it, or sathan; God by his Angels, sathan by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felfe. He watches duely at every houre of death, waites for the soule, would be the Receiver generall: But the just mans Soule God sends for, receives it. Enough for the Act; come to the Object, <hi>my Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="78" facs="tcp:173124:49"/>
            <p>The Spirit and Soule are one. Soules are called so, and are so. Cald so often in Scripture; Are so, Immateriall substances, like unto the Angels. Soule is the baser word, common to beasts, and is but an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident. That indeed dies with the body, ends with it. Spirit is meant of mans soule, never of beasts, save once, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 3. 21. theres <hi>Spiritus Iumentorum.</hi> The soules of beasts perish; but mens spirits are immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall. This doth this Martyr pray Christ to receive. If as a Legacy; it is acceptable to Christ. If as a <hi>Depositum;</hi> it is profitable to <hi>Steven.</hi> For the one, why should I not trust my Spirit unto God, the Father of Spirits? For the other, What should I give unto thee, but my Soule, Oh thou Lover of Soules. The wise man cals God so.</p>
            <p>Take it in the first sense, I have a Husband, or I am under age; I dye by the Law, or I have no estate. I cannot make a Will. Yet die I will not utterly intestate. I have a soule, I will give it, give it to God. Say I have an estate, may make a Will; Yet <hi>my goods (David</hi> saith) <hi>are nothing unto God.</hi> I will give him my Soule. That excels all my temporals. Tis unworthy of God; but the worthiest thing I have. Not <hi>Melius nostrum,</hi> as <hi>Fulgentius</hi> termes it, our better part; but <hi>Nostrum Optimum,</hi> the best thing we have. <hi>Solomon</hi> cals it <hi>Pretious;</hi> thats but in the positive. But the Poet makes comparison, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, nothing of like worth to it. Gods light, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20. Gods delight, his love, you heard before, Oh thou Lover of Soules. Gods breath, <hi>Moses</hi> saith.

So <hi>Origen</hi> saith of this, <hi>In singulis domibus bini aut terni; Bethleem</hi> exceeds <hi>Egypt,</hi> two or three in every house. <hi>Shimei</hi> cal'd <hi>David</hi> a man of bloud; onely for the death of <hi>Abner</hi> and <hi>Ishboshesh;</hi> and yet he had not slaine them neither. Heres a man of bloud, that butchers a whole countrie.</p>
            <p>Nay, this All, is not all yet. The Age of the slaine makes the Act yet more execrable. Tis <hi>from two yeares old and under.</hi> First they must be many, in a Towne, and Countrie round about, a populous Countrie, as <hi>Palestina</hi> was; the number must be great of all the males borne in two whole yeares. That theme I have already prest. But they are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:173124:52"/> too. Rage spares no age, spares not the child scarse a spanne long; slaies in the cradle, rends from the breast; bespraies the sword with the mothers milke, embrewes her breasts with the childs bloud. <hi>Cruor lacteus,</hi> heres milke and bloud, saith <hi>Cyprian,</hi> mixt together. Yea happly some woman that had two sonnes, the one at the dugge, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the lappe, while her love is cleft betweene them both, striving to save one, hath both cleft asunder with the sword. Parent not suffer'd to kisse or see the child alive. Embrace them dead they might, and burie them; well they might doe that.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Esay</hi> saith of <hi>Christ, Puer natus est nobis, a child is borne to us, a sonne is given to us.</hi> They crie here, <hi>Puer raptus est nobis,</hi> our sonnes are pull'd from us, our children rent from us. Happly the butcher is at the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wives heeles, watches the birth, as the <hi>Dragon</hi> doth in the <hi>Apocalypse.</hi> The babe snatcht from her hands into his, slaine betwixt both. <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus dedit, Tyrannus abstulit,</hi> the child no sooner delivered but destroy'd. The midwife shall not neede to cut the navell-string; the butcher will; both it, and navell too. I thinke, <hi>Herod</hi> would doe more, were hee there himselfe; would not waite the birth; as the <hi>Dragon</hi> did; would be more devilish than the devills selfe, would rippe the womans wombe, rend the child out of it, and murther it: happly sheath his sword in the mothers belly, murther both at once▪ Read (who please) the Homilies of the Fathers on this theme; he can not read them with drie eyes. Saint <hi>Basil</hi> makes even the Executioners themselves to have wept for meere compassion: they durst not but doe, what the King had commanded: But their hearts abhor'd what their hands wrought, and their bowels.</p>
            <p>If warre doe this, tis no wonder. If the <hi>Souldier</hi> dash the sucking child against the stones, murther it unborne; I will pardon him, if <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> will doe such an act in peace; make a slaughter, such a slaughter; of children, such children, Infants; such Infants, Males; so many, a whole City, and all the coastes about. No mervaile if mourning and weeping and great lamentation were heard in every house; if <hi>Rachel wept and would not be comforted.</hi> The figure is patheticall. <hi>Rachel</hi> was dead many hundred yeares before. But as at Christs Passion the stones cleft, and the graves opened, and the dead rose: so at the bloudy murther, the mercilesse massacre of these little babes, even <hi>Rachel</hi> rises and bewailes them, weepes for them, though dead and rotten in her grave. No mervaile, if the mother newly brought to bed, seeing her Infant but now borne, presently slaine, doe (as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> speakes) <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:173124:53"/> twas because Gods selfe forbad them. God claimes obedience before Kings; yet that incenst him.

               </gap>, wrath is murthers forerunner: exceeding anger blossoms bloud. But whats the project of this bloud? Be it, <hi>Herod</hi> was both mockt and wroth. Let him be wroth with them, that mockt him; and if wrath will needs slay, let him slay them. <hi>Quid meruere mori?</hi> saith the Christian Poet before cited, what have these Innocent Infants done? No man sheds bloud for the bloud sake: the shedder lookes at some further end. Theres a passion stronger farre than wrath, jelousie. Wrath but boil'd, but jelou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie burnes: thats a furie, this a fiend. [This Act, this odious execrable Act, is <hi>Regni gratia,</hi> tis for a crowne Tis pitty Innocents should be slaine, children, infants, and thousands. But <hi>Nescit pietatis jura,</hi> saith the Tragicke, theres no pittie in this passion.] <hi>Herod</hi> heares of a new King. Theres a babe lately borne, stil'd <hi>King of the Iewes.</hi> Tis <hi>Christ.</hi> Hee feares <hi>Christ</hi> shall uncrowne him, thrust him from the throne: His project is to prevent that. Many a holier man than he, will make no scruple <hi>Regni gratia,</hi> to shed bloud for a crownes sake; to get a crowne, much more to keepe it. Greater griefe to lose, then not to find. Grander disgrace to be unking'd, then never to have raign'd.</p>
            <p>Tis happie, that the Scribes said, Christ should be borne in <hi>Bethleem.</hi> That confind <hi>Herods</hi> furie. Had they said, he should be borne in <hi>Iurie,</hi> it had cost the childrens lives of the whole land. The Wise mens words, (<hi>Where is he, that is borne King of the Iewes?</hi>) troubled <hi>Herod,</hi> the Text saith. <hi>Peremptoria est quaesita altitudo,</hi> Saint <hi>Cyprians</hi> speech. <hi>Herod</hi> had sought the Scepter, bought it too, it is likely, and that dearely, we may thinke, when that a burgeship cost the Captaine a great summe, <hi>Acts</hi> 22. So mounted, he will slay, rather than light. <hi>Imperia pretio quolibet constant benè,</hi> saith <hi>Polynices</hi> in <hi>Seneca,</hi> crownes are not deare at any price though it be bloud, much bloud, innocent bloud. The crownes that we shall weare one day in heaven, Christ bought so. They cost him bloud, innocent bloud, much bloud, even all he had. As <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes</hi> mother said in another sense, <hi>Occidat modò imperet.</hi> What cares <hi>Herod</hi> to kill, so he may raigne? Of <hi>Othoes</hi> minde the Emperour, <hi>stare se non posse, nisi principem,</hi> He can not live, but a King, die who shall, so he may live so. <hi>Herods</hi> feare needed not. Christ came to suffer, not to raigne; to weare a crowne, but twas of thornes; to beare a Scepter, but of reed. Christ was a King, and of the <hi>Iewes: Nathanael</hi> stil'd him King of <hi>Israel.</hi> The Wise men expresly, <hi>King of Jewes,</hi> both of <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles.</hi> But his kingdome was not of this world. The Popes is, his Vicar: but not his. Yet <hi>Herod</hi> feared; and feare is a murtherer.

                  </gap> est,</hi> then he will shed bloud. But a Tragicall argument should not be long. Be it here ended, but ended with prayer and thansgiving for our happy dayes wherein we have no bloudy <hi>Herod,</hi> but a gracious King, under whom we may goe to heaven without martyrdome, unlesse it be that holy martyrdome of our vices, which in the <hi>Collect</hi> for this Day, we desire <hi>God to mortifie and kill in us, that in our conversations our life may expresse that faith, which with our tongues we doe confesse, &amp;c.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE first word of my Text (I meane in the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall) doth denominate this day, called the <hi>Epiphany,</hi> of the <hi>Appearance</hi> of a <hi>Starre.</hi> I have made choice of it, both for the cognation of the name, and for the parallele argument. For it hath also an <hi>Epiphany,</hi> the <hi>Appearance</hi> of <hi>Grace.</hi> That starre was Gods grace, to guide the wise men unto Christ; this grace is Gods starre to lead all men to Salvation. For what is the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, but Gods Loadstone unto Life? By it Gods gracious purpose of saving all mankind, couched by the Prophets, as under a cloud, brake forth by the Apostles, and gave shine to all the world. As then the Title of this Day, so is the matter of this Text, a glorious <hi>Epiphany,</hi> that is, a <hi>Shine,</hi> and an <hi>Appearance.</hi> The subject of the shine, <hi>Gods Grace.</hi> The project of that Grace, it is <hi>Salvation,</hi> the object of Salvation, it is, <hi>All men. There is appeared the Grace of God, which bringeth Salvation to all men.</hi> Of these foure points, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Say we not of nature, <hi>Nihil agit frustra,</hi> it doth nought in vaine? Is it true of nature, and is it false of God? Gods purpose of Salvation were meerely to no purpose, should it not in time be both publisht and effected. Both which honourable offices are performed by the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell. The letter of it beares the newes; the spirit of it workes the Grace. Vaine is the meaning that never doth appeare. Gods grace is but his
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:173124:54"/> meaning, knowne only to himselfe. It must have an appearance to make it knowne to man. And that not a darke, an obscure appearance onely (for that were but <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, as a cunning picture craves a choice light, it must be an <hi>Epiphany,</hi> a bright shining forth; not <hi>apparuit,</hi> but <hi>illuxit,</hi> Saint <hi>Hierom,</hi> and Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> have it; <hi>illuxit gratia Dei, Gods grace hath appeared.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Prophets gave some glimpse, by which Gods purposed grace was seene by some. But the cleare light of the Gospell made it visible to all. Their light was but a Candle, which gives them onely light, that are in the house. It shone unto the <hi>Iewes,</hi> who then alone were of Gods Family. But the Gospels light is as the Sunne, which giveth shine to the whole world. <hi>Ambulabunt gentes in lumine tuo; that light</hi> (saith the Prophet) <hi>shall give luster to all lands.</hi> As once in <hi>Goshen,</hi> so then in <hi>Iury.</hi> the Hebrewes onely had the light; and the Nations, like the Egyptians, sat all in darkenesse: But the Gospell, as <hi>Simeon</hi> singeth in his hymne, was to be a <hi>light to lighten the Gentiles;</hi> and as <hi>Zachary</hi> in his, the beames gave <hi>light to them that sate in darkenesse, Luke</hi> 1. 79. there is our word againe; and the shine shot forth unto the shadow of death. I say Gods grace from all eternity had foreordained all men to this Salvation. But that gracious purpose he kept many ages secret to himselfe. Only now and than to the Patriarcks and Prophets it pleased him to impart it, but closely and obscurely. But when the time was full, and that Christ was now incarnate <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> cals him to the Hebrewes, the Prince of this Salvation; it pleased him to reveale that long concealed Counsell, by the pennes and Preaching of the Apostles and Evangelists to all nations under Heaven. And that is the Appearance of the Grace of God, the glorious <hi>Epiphany</hi> of the <hi>Grace of God,</hi> here meant by our Apostle: farre paramont to that of the wise men of the East, which led them onely but to Christ a King: but this conducts all nations unto Christ a Saviour.</p>
            <p>We learne of the Philosopher, that <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things are, but yet appeare not; that have existence, but not appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. Such a thing was this Salvation: it had the being onely in Gods hidden will, it appeared not unto men. I meane the common salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as Saint <hi>Iude</hi> termeth it, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. I know the <hi>Psalmist</hi> saith, that <hi>God was knowne in Iudah, and his Grace was great in Israel.</hi> But the name of a Saviour was not heard among the heathen. Gods grace meant to communicate salvation to all soules. But his meaning was a mystery, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3. 9. As Gods selfe was unknowne, even to the learnedst of the Gentiles, even at <hi>Athens</hi> the <hi>Altar</hi> was found by Saint <hi>Paul, engraven, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to the unknowne God:</hi> as Gods selfe was unknowne, so was his Grace much more; But the Gospell proclaming redemption to all people, made grace appeare to men. Not barely to appeare, like the dawning of the morning; so it did before: but <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to breake forth in brightnesse, and to shine clearely like the noone Sunne.</p>
            <p>For it is fit, that the Appearance beare some proportion with the grace. The grace great, <hi>the Salvation of man:</hi> and therefore the light great. <hi>Math. 4. 17. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, an admirable light. So was it fit for the Authors sake; for the light was sent from the father of lights, and so was it also for the spectators sake: the light must be great, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable great, that all shall see, and the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> telleth us, that <hi>all the ends of the earth shall see the Salvation of God.</hi> As by Gods grace it was purposed to all men: so by the Gospell it should be publisht to all men.</p>
            <p>Hence is it, that the Apostles and all Preachers of the Gospell are called Starres and lights. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> cals them one, <hi>Christ</hi> calles them both. <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> the first preacher is called <hi>a shining light.</hi> Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> cals the Apostles <hi>magna Ecclesiae luminaria,</hi> the great lights of the Church.

The Apostle in that Chapter is plentifull in phrases serving to this sense.</p>
            <p>To end this point; the Scripture, (saith Saint <hi>Gregory</hi>) is <hi>Epistola Creatoris,</hi> Gods Epistle to his Creature. The Scriptures are Gods Letters, we call them <hi>Sacras literas,</hi> they are Gods holy Letters, sent unto his Church, to signifie <hi>Salvation</hi> meant <hi>to all mankind.</hi> What the grace of God decreed, that the Word of God declared.

The Gospel is the <hi>Appearance,</hi> the <hi>Epiphany</hi> of that grace; and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called, <hi>Act. 20. 24. The Gospell of the Grace of God.

               </gap>, <hi>it is the gift of God. Rom.</hi> 6. 23. Both beginning and progresse, and execution of Salvation, is all from <hi>Grace.</hi> This is the Riches of Gods grace, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 7. Yea <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, the exceeding, the hyperbolicall riches of his grace. <hi>Ephe.</hi> 2. 7. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this attribute is put into Gods stile, proclamed by Gods selfe, <hi>Exo.</hi> 34. 6. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap> the gratious God: so rich, so exceeding rich in grace; that the Apostles entitle him the God of grace, and his spirit, the spirit of grace, and his throne, the throne of grace.</p>
            <p>I say, by Gods grace is not meant any thing created, or infused in us; but Gods voluntary favour, his francke and free affection, and meere mercy in <hi>Christ Iesus.</hi> Not onely workes are weake, but faith also though the chiefest of his outflowing graces, is too feeble to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the Salvation of mans soule. Mans merits, saith Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> drive to desperation; so farre are they from saving us. Doe thornes yeeld grapes, or plucke we figges of thistles? If grace could possibly grow, out of God, that thing in the Creature, which should moove it, must be good, as grace it selfe is. But we know with Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> that there is no good in man. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 18. Surely some is sometimes, as it sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth from Gods Spirit; but the Flesh marreth it. What good soever is by God infused in us, it is instantly infected by our in-bred corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and so no fit moover of the good grace of God. And therefore that Paradoxe of the Pelagians, that the ground of Gods grace, was the foresight of mans merit, is a franticke heresie. Not Gods Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of goodnesse in man, but his conscience of goodnesse in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, mooved him to be gracious.</p>
            <p>Gods grace hath no dependance out of Gods selfe, (as once <hi>Pelagius</hi> held, and laid a part of it on man) but solely and wholely relieth on Gods pleasure. For how shall the effect father his owne cause? All grace in man doth issue from grace in God, which therefore cannot rise from ought in man. Gods Will is the wombe that first conceived it, <hi>his beneplacitum begat it first, and as the prima matrix; so it is the prima motrix:</hi> the first moover of Gods mercy.</p>
            <p>Grace then is free: for else it were not grace. It is Saint <hi>Augustins</hi> speech, <hi>Gratia si non est gratis, non est gratia.</hi> Grace is no debt, God owes it not. Wrath is a debt, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> but grace is no debt, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, saith Saint <hi>Basil;</hi> and it seemes Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> hath tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated it. For he calles <hi>poenam debitam, but gratiam indebitam.</hi> Death is a paine, God owes us that; but life is a favour, and God owes not it. <hi>Exercet debitam severitatem, exhibet indebitam pietatem,</hi> saith the same Father. Salvation is like the raine; God sends it freely; It costs no price, nor paines; man buies it not, man earnes it not. We have it <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, saith the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 24. that is, of gift; and what is freer then gift?</p>
            <pb n="91" facs="tcp:173124:55"/>
            <p>To end this second point, Damnation is of right, but salvation is of Grace. The wicked man may challenge hell; or if he will not challenge it, it will chalenge him. But the righteous man can not claime heaven; the tenure of the Saints is but franke almoigne. Death is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a debt to sinne, but life is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a franke and free favour. Not <hi>merces <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ppe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantis,</hi> but <hi>munus largientis, Ambr.</hi> not a wages, but a largesse. In a word, it is not a dutie, but it is a bountie, it is not of merit, but it is of Grace, and so much for the second point.</p>
            <p>The next point in the Scripture is the project of this grace; and that is <hi>salvation:</hi> that is, <hi>propositum gratiae,</hi> as the Apostle termeth it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 5. the Greeke copies have it not, but the Latine have; and Saint <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose</hi> doth warrant it.</p>
            <p>A project worthy of the grace of God; it is so rich and infinite in sweetnesse. For it containes both tuition from all evill, and fruition of all good. Man can not have more, God can not give more. Tuition from all evill, from sinne, from death, from Sathan, and from hell. Fruition of all good, of life, of heaven, of glory, and of joy: of the blessed presence of Saints, of Angells, and of God himselfe. I say, tui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from all evill; from sinne, I meane the sting of it. Grace hath pull'd it out: from death, I meane the curse of it, grace hath cancell'd it. From the clawes of Sathan, Grace hath chipped them; and from the chawes of hell, Grace hath choked them. And fruition of all good; of life, it is eternall: of heaven, it is a kingdome, a weight of glory, and a world of joy. Of the Saints and Angells presence; alwayes praising God: yea, the vision of Gods selfe, unexpressible of words, uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveable by wit. This is the <hi>Salvation, which the Grace of God doth bring;</hi> and that unto all men. It is the last point of my Text.</p>
            <p>The Object of <hi>Salvation,</hi> is the whole world: <hi>Grace bringeth</hi> it <hi>to all</hi> men. First <hi>men;</hi> then <hi>all.</hi> He saith not Beasts, nor Angells, but <hi>all men.</hi> That man were brutish, that should beleeve salvation belonged to brute creatures. And yet there is a <hi>Psalme,</hi> that seemes to save them to. See (I pray you) the 7. <hi>verse</hi> of the 36. <hi>Psalme: Thou O Lord</hi> (saith <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid) dost save both man and beast.</hi> But the <hi>Psalmist</hi> meaneth there, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation, not salvation. Gods feedes them, and provides for them: but he saves them not. Hee expounds himselfe else where, <hi>God giveth food to all flesh, and feedeth the young Ravens that call upon him.</hi> Beasts, foules and fishes, and some creeping things Astronomers have put in heaven; but grace admits no such. And for the Angells; surely sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation doth belong to them. But it was beside <hi>Pauls</hi> purpose; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he names them not, but onely men; and that with a note of univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salitie it is, to <hi>all men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not <hi>Origens all;</hi> who extended this grace not onely to all men, but to the devills to, <hi>tantò errans perversiùs, quantò sentiens clementius, Aug.</hi> of perverse pitie would have no man damned. The terme is to be taken not individually, but generally, but to all men, that is, all Ages, all Nations, all conditions; the grace of God bringeth salvation to them all.</p>
            <p>Will you see it in the first? Gods goodnesse is a fountaine; it is never drie. As grace is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> from the worlds beginning, <hi>Psa.</hi> 25. so it is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to the worlds end, <hi>Psal. 136. à seculo in seculum,</hi> from one generation to
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:173124:56"/> another. Salvation is no termer; grace ties it not to times. <hi>Noah</hi> as well as <hi>Abel, Moses</hi> as well as <hi>Iacob, Ieremy</hi> as well as <hi>David, Paul</hi> as well as <hi>Simeon</hi> hath part in this Salvation. Gods gracious pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the Flood drowned not, the smoke of <hi>Sinai</hi> smothered not, the Captivity ended not, the ends of the world (Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calles them so) determined not. For <hi>Christ</hi> by whom it is, was slaine from the beginning, Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> saith so. He was before <hi>Abraham,</hi> himselfe saith so. And <hi>Clem. Alex. tomo quinto. 5. pag.</hi> 233. doth <hi>Marcion</hi> wrong, though otherwise an hereticke, in blaming him for holding, that Christ saved those also that beleeved in him, before his incarnation. The blood of the beasts under the law was type of his. And the scarres of his wounds appeare yet still, and will for ever, till he come to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Apostle shall end this; he is <hi>heri,</hi> and <hi>hodie,</hi> and <hi>semper i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem, Christ</hi> is the same, yesterday, to day, and for ever.</p>
            <p>Will you see it in the second? Grace is a grand Ocean, it compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the earth. Gods goodnesse is a fountaine, streaming forth Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into all lands. The Church indeed (as <hi>Solomon</hi> cals it in his song) is <hi>an enclosed garden, and a parke impaled.</hi> But the pale and the enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure are not for the pinfolding of the Church, but for the propriety and safety of the Church. The Church, it is scattered over the face of the earth; not impounded in <hi>Palestine,</hi> as it was sometime; but the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then also are Christs enheritance, and his possession, the ends of the world. The Gentiles saith the Apostle, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3. 6. are <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, joynt-tenants of the Gospell, and coheires of Salvation. God gathereth heires of his kingdome from the foure windes; he hath called the earth from the rising of the Sunne unto the West. The Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost breathed into all quarters under Heaven, and conveid Gods saving health from <hi>Tabor</hi> to <hi>Hermon,</hi> and from the Sea, unto the worlds end. <hi>Christ</hi> hath bought all nations for a price; and all flesh saith <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> shall see Gods Salvation. The infinite vertue and efficacy of Christs satisfaction reacheth to the saving of all <hi>Adams</hi> sonnes, wheresoever seated. For it were absurd to thinke, that the power of the second <hi>Adam</hi> the Lord Christ were lesse unto life, then the first was unto death. But as <hi>Adam tabificavit, sic Christus justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit omnes, August. as by one man Adam,</hi> the wrath of God, and the curse, which came by it, caught hold of all: <hi>so by one man Christ,</hi> so much as in him lay, <hi>the grace of God,</hi> and the gift which is by grace, that is, Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation <hi>hath abounded unto all.</hi> The Greeke word is elegant <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 15. the grace of God <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, saith <hi>Paul.</hi> Grace doth not onely <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, burst forth with power to save; but also <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, it breakes forth round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, to save all men. <hi>All men,</hi> that is, all nations? How then (as saith our Saviour) is Salvation of the Iewes, <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 22? It is not <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, not of them as their propriety, but either from them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Gospell that preacheth it, came forth of <hi>Iewry;</hi> or else out of them; because Christ, that procureth it, was borne of them. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the wheele of the Gospell, which is the charet of Salvation, is rolled (saith <hi>Gregory Nyssen.</hi>) through the whole earth. Gods grace by that drawght conveies it to all people; and is therefore justly called by Saint <hi>Iude,</hi> the <hi>common Salvation, ver.</hi> 3. as common to all ages, so
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:173124:56"/> also to all lands. Grace will not be confinde. For Gods goodnesse cannot be exhausted; he is <hi>Dives in omnes,</hi> saith the Apostle, rich e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for all.</p>
            <p>Will you see it in the third? Grace brings Salvation to all sorts of men. God is no <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, he hath no respect of Persons. Doth the poore man doubt? Let him looke at <hi>Lazarus;</hi> hee lies in <hi>Abrahams</hi> bosome. Doth the rich man doubt? <hi>Christ</hi> said to rich <hi>Zaccheus, this day is Salvation come unto thy house.</hi> No age excepted; children and infants, yea the babe that dies unborne, are in the covenant, which God hath made unto their parents. No Sexe excepted: though wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man sinned before man, yet shee is saved as well as man. <hi>Mary</hi> in her song calleth God her <hi>Saviour.</hi> Nay sinne it selfe excepteth not, so there be repentance; <hi>to day</hi> (saith <hi>Christ</hi> to the thiefe upon the Crosse) <hi>thou shalt be with me in Paradise.</hi> Yea <hi>Paul</hi> the chiefe of sinners (for so hee calles himselfe) a persecutor of the Saints, yet obtained his Salvation. The comming of Christ was of purpose to save sinners.</p>
            <p>To conclude; God is no niggard of his grace; grace is no grudger of Salvation. With him (saith the <hi>Psalme</hi>) is <hi>copiosa redemptio.</hi> It is an excellent attribute, which is given him by Saint <hi>Iames</hi> 5. 11. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>. In Gods mercy there is both <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

The Particle, the first word of it bids us see the <hi>verse</hi> before, as containing a Reason of the matter in that <hi>verse.</hi> In that, he humbly resign'd his life to God. This yeelds a reason of that resignation, Because his eyes had now beheld the Lords Christ. So the Argument of my text, is his thankefull acknowledgement of Gods performed promise; who had graciously vouchsafed him, though a very aged Father; yet before hee should die, the sight of the <hi>Messias.</hi> That <hi>Messias, Simeon</hi> here calls <hi>Salvation.

For mine eyes have seene thy salvation.</hi> Of these five points, my purpose is to speake, God assisting, in that order, in which the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Latine, and Originall have marshal'd them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Viderunt</hi> is the first, in which I note two points, one of the sense, an other of the tense. For the former: The Ages both before Christ, and since his comming, have believed on Christ: but <hi>Simeon</hi> beheld him. He was prophesied of to them, and he is preached of to us; but hee is
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:173124:57"/> seene by <hi>Simeon.</hi> Faith apprehends the Object more certainely, then sense: for sense may be deceived; Faith can not. The eye may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded many wayes. The sight may be feeble. The Object may have art in it. God may hold the eyes. Faith the immediate and meere worke of God, given of purpose to assure, cannot be beguiled. Faith appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends the Object more certainely then sense: but Sense apprehendeth it more presently then Faith: and in that respect Sight farre excelleth Faith. The dead doe see themselves in heaven now: the alive beleeve to be there one day. <hi>Hodie mihi, cras tibi:</hi> Give me to day; take who will to morrow.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Christ</hi> saith, <hi>they are blessed, qui non viderunt, sed crediderunt, that have not seene Christ, but beleeved:</hi> Then are they <hi>terque quaterque,</hi> much more blessed, that have beleeved, and seene too, and so <hi>Greg. Nyssen</hi> calls <hi>Simeon</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. But faith without sense, hath great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: but <hi>occulata fides,</hi> faith seconded by sight, is great happinesse. <hi>Beati oculi</hi> is Christs saying too, <hi>blessed are the eyes, that see the things you see.</hi> I say not, that have seene and beleeved, seene first, and then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved. Faith bred of sense is not thankeworthy; but that have beleev'd and seene: and so doth <hi>Simeon.</hi> His soule is so satisfied, now his eyes have seene his Saviour, that hee is well content to die: <hi>Lord now lettest thou thy servant go in peace.</hi> Nay he desires to be dissolv'd; some Fathers read <hi>Dimitie,</hi> and the Syriacke hath it so to, <hi>Lord now let thy servant.</hi> Like <hi>Iacob,</hi> willing with all his hart to die, when he saw that <hi>Ioseph</hi> liv'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Abraham</hi> desir'd to see him. <hi>Iacob</hi> waited for him, <hi>expecto</hi> (saith the Patriarch even on his death bed) <hi>Salutare tuum, I waite for thy salvation. David</hi> begged it, <hi>Psal. 85. Da salutare tuum.</hi> He prayed for him; yea his heart longed after him, <hi>Ps. 119. 81. Defecit ani ma mea in salutare tuum,</hi> his soule even sowned in desire of him. For that the <hi>Psalmist</hi> meanes of the <hi>Messias.</hi> S. <hi>Austin</hi> is my Author, <hi>Quid est salutare tuum, nisi Christus tuus?</hi> he saith, it was Christ, who was meant hy that salvation. <hi>Abraham</hi> the <hi>Father</hi> of Beleevers, and the <hi>Friend</hi> of God; <hi>Iacob</hi> a wrestler with Angells, and <hi>David</hi> a man after Gods owne heart; what all these three desired, and obtained not, God here vouchsafeth <hi>Simeon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Herod</hi> a King desir'd to see him, and was glad, <hi>gavisus valde,</hi> excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding glad, when he saw him. The Wise men of the East, Kings too, say some, came a great journey to see him, and were glad, <hi>gavisi gaudio magno valdè,</hi> with an exceeding great gladnesse. This Object so desir'd by such, Kings, Prophets, Patriarkes, desir'd by so many; as <hi>Haggei</hi> speakes, the desire of all Nations, it pleased God to shew to this aged holy Father.</p>
            <p>This is the meed of faith, Gods rich reward of mans beliefe. <hi>Simeon</hi> beleev'd, before he saw; and therefore now he saw, what hee beleev'd. The storie saith, <hi>he waited for the consolation of Israel;</hi> that is, expected the <hi>Messias.</hi> And (as a Father saith) the reward of beleeving without sight, is to see, what thou beleevest. <hi>Expectator</hi> is made <hi>Spectator:</hi> the Object of his faith is now subject to his sight. A sight so joyfull, that the people, albeit he were daily in their streets, yet thronged to behold him. Not Ship, not Mount, not Desert could keepe him from the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. They were so glad of him, so eager, so importunate; that hee
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:173124:58"/> scarse had time to eate for them. Hee could not be so private, but they would find him out; and when they had him, they would hold him, and would not let him goe, <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 42. Nay his sight so joyfull, that one longing to behold him, but not able for the prease, and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his stature; <hi>Zaccheus</hi> a rich man, and principall of the Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, stucke not at the scruple of his reputation, but ranne before, and got up into a tree, glad to see him so: but when Christ said to him, hee would be his guest, his soule was so ravish'd with extraordinary joy; that besides his quicke descending, and most cheerefull entertainement, he frankely vowed the halfe of his goods unto the poore, and a foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold restitution of all he had got wrongfully.</p>
            <p>Now for the tense, <hi>viderunt, Simeon</hi> was promised, hee should see Christ: he sees him now indeed. <hi>Balaam</hi> said, <hi>videbo, I shall see him, but not now.</hi> The difference betweene the New Testament and the Old is but in tense onely. It was then <hi>Suscitabit,</hi> the Lord shall raise, saith <hi>Moses,</hi> shall <hi>raise to you a Prophet like to me.

            <p>There is a sight of Faith, the Patriarkes saw Christ so. <hi>Abraham</hi> did, Christ saith it, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8. 56.

            <p>There is yet another sight in Scripture, <hi>Auricularis,</hi> a sight by eare. <hi>Videbat voces, Exod.</hi> 20. the people saw the sound of the thunder. Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> sees the like, <hi>Apoc. 1. ut videret vocem,</hi> he sees a voyce. Sight so excells among the senses, that they all usurpe it.

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:173124:58"/>
               <hi>Iohn</hi> would see it. So would the tongue. <hi>Psalme 34. Gustate &amp; videte.</hi> So would the hand, <hi>Luke 24.

            <p>There is an other eare-sight, which is heare-say. <hi>Herod</hi> saw Christ so, I meane <hi>Herod</hi> the Babe slayer. The blind saw him so.

            <p>The next terme notes the owner of this instrument; the eyes are <hi>his. My eyes have seene.</hi> As I may see, and yet haply not by eye; so may I see by eye, and yet haply it not mine. My neighbours eye, or my friends may see for me. <hi>Oculus usurarius.</hi> He can lend me his eye, as well as his hand. <hi>Symeon</hi> sees Christ, not <hi>per alium,</hi> but himselfe. There is <hi>Oculus Vicarius:</hi> All sight is not in person. Bishops by name are seers, <hi>Episcopi,</hi> Overseers, but not everseers by themselves. There is a Church officer, whom the Canon Law calles <hi>Oculum Episcopi,</hi> the Bishops eye, to see for him. Kings see with eyes, but not their owne. Magistrates and Iudges in the common wealth are Princes eyes, they see by them. But <hi>Symeon</hi> sees Christ, as <hi>Iob</hi> hoped he should see him; <hi>My</hi> eyes, saith <hi>Iob,</hi> not others for me. <hi>Viderunt Oculi mei, My Eyes,</hi> saith <hi>Symeon, have seene thy Salvation.</hi> The phrase is often, but it is not heere an idle <hi>Pleonasmus,</hi> but an earnest <hi>Emphasis;</hi> as if a man would say, <hi>hisce occulis vidi,</hi> I have seene him with these eyes. <hi>Symeons</hi> selfe, <hi>owne</hi> selfe, with <hi>his</hi> eyes, his <hi>owne</hi> eyes personally beholds his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</p>
            <p>The eyes of the aged have lightly but bad sight, if they have any▪ <hi>Symeon</hi> had small cause to hope to see his Saviour; he was so old a man; but that divine Revelation had encouraged him; and as <hi>Nicephorus</hi> writes, his age was prorogued of purpose for that spectacle. But being blinde besides, as <hi>Celsus</hi> writes in <hi>Cypriam,</hi> to have his sight restored him at his embracing of the Babe, was more miraculous. And the terme is not redundant, but fit it should be added, and his voice advanced
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:173124:59"/> with accent beseeming it, <hi>My eyes have seene thy Salvation.</hi> As if <hi>David</hi> meant of him, that saying in the <hi>Psalmes▪ Longitudine dierum, with length of dayes will I satisfie him, and I will shew him my Salvation.</hi>

There are three unhappy heretickes, though happy all in name, <hi>Faustus</hi> and <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix,</hi> and <hi>Fortunatus,</hi> three Manichees, and some more, who deny that Christ was man, but onely God.

               </gap>, saith the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelist, not this man onely, but not any ever saw. Christs body was <hi>phantasticum,</hi> his flesh but <hi>putativa,</hi> his birth and death and all things concerning his humanity, were but <hi>imaginaria,</hi> all but meere apparencies. If so; ther. <hi>Simeon</hi> saw him not indeed; but thought he saw him onely. He saith he saw him; but it was <hi>deceptio visus,</hi> deceipt of sight. He saith, his eyes had seene him; but <hi>Oculi</hi> (saith the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour) <hi>sape mentiuntur,</hi> the eyes doe often leaze, This franticke he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie, so grosse, so crosse to all Scripture, to all sense, is not worth the answearing. Christ, though he was not <hi>mere homo,</hi> as <hi>Arius</hi> held blasphemously, yet that he was <hi>vere homo,</hi> man truely, though not onely, what point in all Divinity hath proofe more plaine, more plentifull? and I have already handled this question heere be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>The Object is now next; what <hi>Simeon</hi> saw; tis Gods <hi>Salvation.</hi> Twas no such great priviledge, such an honour to see Christ. What is <hi>Christus</hi> more then <hi>Vnctus?</hi> it signifies but one annointed. Kings are so, men may see them daily; Wee may: God grant that long we may. But <hi>Simeon</hi> sees <hi>Salutare tuum,</hi> not Christ, but Iesus, that is, Salvation. Christ, <hi>i e.</hi> Vnction, I confesse, is sweete; the Spouse cries in the <hi>Canticles, Oleum effusum nomen tuum,</hi> his name like pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious ointment. But <hi>Iesus, i. e.</hi> Salvation is more sweete by much, <hi>Mel in ore,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Bernard,</hi> that but oile, this Hony: and <hi>what</hi> saith <hi>Sampson,</hi> is <hi>sweeter then Hony?</hi> Salvation sweet every way, sweete to the taste, <hi>in ore mel,</hi> to the eare, <hi>in aure melos,</hi> to the heart, <hi>in corde jubilus,</hi> saith that Father. This Father therefore chooseth this terme rather, his eyes see Gods Salvation. Christ is the same with Iesus; but unto every seer, Christ is not the same. <hi>Simeon</hi> sees him a Saviour. Many saw him, but not their Saviour. The Scribes and Pharisees saw him their Censurer. The devils saw him their destroyer. His Crucifiers shall see him at the Resurrection, <hi>Omnes Oculus,</hi> saith Saint

               </gap> (saith Saint <hi>Basil</hi>) it is the use of Scripture to call Christ Gods salvation, <hi>Iacob</hi> call'd him so, you heard before.

               </gap>, elegantly conjoyning both Hebrew Etymologie and Greeke together; of his soveraigne salving, that is, as the Angell derives it in Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi> of saving us from sinne.

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the greatest and royallest of all the Acts of God. The Act so individually, so personally true, so proper unto Christ; that the name of a Saviour is given him transcendently. His proper name is <hi>Iesus,</hi> it signifies a Saviour. Yet that contents not Christians, but they put to the Appellative, and surname him Saviour too, <hi>Iesus Christ our Saviour.</hi> And lest you may object, that that is done in zeale, in ignorant zeale: Gods Spirit doth it too, often in the Scripture.

               </gap>, the Saviour, that is, the Saviour paramaunt the right, the high Arch-Saviour. Nay Gods Spirit rests not there; but for yet the greater emphasis, puts it in the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract here, and else where often, not Saviour, but savation. a close insinuation of the childs Deitie. Tis <hi>Dionysius</hi> his Rule, that names are given God most properly <hi>in Abstracto,</hi> God not Wise, but Wisedome; not Righteous, but Righteousnesse; not a Saviour, but <hi>Salvation.</hi>

               </gap>, of the quite contrarie. Names often faile, imposed by men, never by God. <hi>Absalom,</hi> a father of peace, so meanes his name, proved a sonne of murther and rebellion. God nam'd Christ, <hi>Iesus. Simeon</hi> here expounds it, to be salvation. And (as the <hi>Samaritans</hi> say in <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 42. he was <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a right Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour indeed. How? For he hath saved his people, all people, from all enemies: not worldly, thats a light salvation; yet hee does that too; but Ghostly, thats the right salvation. Not from <hi>Egypt,</hi> or <hi>Amaleke,</hi> not <hi>Madian</hi> or <hi>Moab,</hi> not the <hi>Philistims</hi> or <hi>Assyrians,</hi> as <hi>Moses</hi> did <hi>Israel,</hi> and <hi>Sampson</hi> and <hi>Iosua,</hi> call'd Saviours too in Scripture: and yet this Saviour wrought those salvations too; they were but his instruments,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:173124:60"/> but vice-saviours. Had this Arch-Saviour not assisted them, the fellest of those enemies could but kill the bodie. But our Sauiour hath saved us from the assaulters of our soules: the guilt of sinne, the curse of God, the treacherie of the flesh, the sorcerie of the world, the sentence of death, the clawes of Sathan, and the chawes of hell. All these, not the spillers of our bloud, but the killers of our soules, this <hi>Iesus,</hi> this Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our hath saved us from them all.</p>
            <p>The world had enveigled our flesh, the flesh had enthralled us to sinne, Sinne had enwrapt us in the curse, the curse had adjudged us to death, Death had delivered us to Sathan, and Sathan had enjayled us in hell. But as old <hi>Zacharie</hi> singeth in his Hymne, <hi>God hath raised us a Saviour in the house of David,</hi> that should deliver us from all these enemies. The world is a Witch, but not to be feared: our Saviours self hath said it, <hi>Ego vici mundū, I have overcome the world.</hi> The pricke of the flesh, his grace hath blunted it. The wound of sinne his bloud hath salved it. The vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of the Curse his Crosse hath voided it. The doome of Death his death diverted it. The pawes of Sathan his bands have chained them, and the jawes of hell his thornes have choked them.</p>
            <p>To shut up this point, the Apostle telleth us, that the comming of Christ was of purpose for to save, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. Yea our Saviours selfe tells us so, that the Sonne of man came to save that was lost; both the true Saviour, as you heard of the <hi>Samaritanes,</hi> and the onely Saviour, so proclaimed by Saint <hi>Peter, Non est nomen aliud, there is none other name under heaven, by which we may be saved.</hi> Not that the Father and the holy Ghost are excluded from this act. They both as well as Christ, may be said to be our Saviours. For the workes of the Trinitie, which the Schoolemen terme <hi>ad extra</hi> belong to all the Persons. But the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Spirit <hi>authoritativè,</hi> the Sonne <hi>executivè.</hi> The power and commission is common to all three, the execution proper to Christ onely. And <hi>Barnardine Ochinus</hi> was not in his wits, who because Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith in the <hi>Acts,</hi> that God hath purchased his Church with his bloud, would have therefore God the Father to take this name on him, as if his bloud were shed. And <hi>Peter Gnapheus</hi> a madder man than hee, who would joyne all the persons coexecutours with Christ; all three to have been crucified, and so Saviours all three.

               </gap>, the Saviour is Christ: else should the name of <hi>Iesus</hi> be put upon the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the holy Ghost, as well as upon Christ. I come to the last word, <hi>Salutare tuum, thy salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This salvation is call'd Gods, whether as the owner, <hi>Christus autem dei,</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Christ is Gods, 1 Cor.</hi> 3. 23. or the Doner; for hee gave him, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. I will not argue. Gods, whether <hi>Possessivè,</hi> the Saviour is his Sonne; or <hi>Processivè,</hi> salvation is his act. An Act worthy such an Agent: <hi>Nihil tam dignum Deo, quàm salus hominum, Tertull.</hi> No worke so worthy God, as mans salvation. Gods; for he sent him, saith the Apostle. I cannot send him, who is an others. Gods; for he gave him, saith Christs selfe. I can not giue, that is not mine. Though he be <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus Dominus;</hi> yet he is <hi>Christus Domini</hi> too, as <hi>verse</hi> 26, though Christ the Lord, yet the Lords Christ.</p>
            <pb n="101" facs="tcp:173124:60"/>
            <p>Gods, and yet mans too. Mans <hi>Passively; Marie</hi> turnes the Pronoune, <hi>My soule rejoyceth, in salutare meo, in God my savation.</hi> So doth the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Habacuk, in Deo Iesu meo,</hi> in God my Saviour. But Gods active<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly▪ <hi>Domini est salus,</hi> salvation, true salvation is all Gods. The Church militant sings it in the <hi>Psalme, Psal. 3. ult.</hi> The Church triumphant sings it in the <hi>Revelations, Salus à Domino,</hi> Salvation is of God. So truely Gods, that the relation is reciprocall; as it <hi>Salus Domini,</hi> the Lords sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; so he <hi>Salutis Dominus,</hi> often in the <hi>Psalmes,</hi> the Lord of salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; meant not of actions onely of salvation, literally; but of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so also of the Saviour mystically. Thy salvation, that is, Gods: God the Fathers, as begot by him, as he was God, God the holy Ghosts, as conceived by him, as he was man.</p>
            <p>There are many Christs, and many Saviours, this is Gods. Christs selfe foretold of many Christs; <hi>Christus hîc, Christus illîc.</hi> These were all the divills Christs. But this, the holy Ghost in <hi>Simeons</hi> Revelation calls <hi>Christus Domini, the Lords Christ.</hi> There are many Saviours and salvations, but not Gods. There is <hi>Salus hominis, Psal.</hi> 60. Mans salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Men have their Saviours. The Mammonist hath his; the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nist hath his. <hi>Mammon</hi> workes great salvations, too great, too often, to too many. The malefactor hath an enemie, a sworne enemie, that threatens him shame, publike shame; Death, shamefull death. It is the law. <hi>Mammon</hi> can save him from this enemie. It can be but some-where. and but sometimes. An uncertaine saviour. Nay <hi>Mammons</hi> selfe oft needs a saviour; subject to thiefe, wrecke, fire, and other casualties. A sory saviour: he saveth others, as they said of Christ, himselfe he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not save.</p>
            <p>The Romanist hath better, the Saints. <hi>Mammon</hi> saves but from some evills; Saints from all. Saint <hi>Laurence</hi> from fire; yea though it be <hi>ignis sacer.</hi> Saint <hi>Anthony</hi> even from that. Saint <hi>Margaret</hi> from the paines of childbirth. Saint <hi>Leonard</hi> from bands; but that <hi>Mammon</hi> can doe too. Saint <hi>Valentine</hi> from the falling-sicknesse. Saint <hi>Roch,</hi> and <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bastian</hi> from the plague. What cite I bodily distresses? Saints are Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours also to their soules. They save them from Gods anger, from Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, sinne, and hell. For you must thinke they heare their prayers, and they see their wants. <hi>Iohn</hi> could heare a voyce from heaven: can not they as well from earth? Is not <hi>Athens</hi> as neere <hi>Thebes,</hi> as <hi>Thebes</hi> to <hi>Athens?</hi> Earth to Heaven, as Heaven to it? Nay, somewhat nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer: for sound ascends more easily, than comes downe. Marry then you must looke you speake out when you pray; for they confesse, they know not the secrets of mens hearts: And I crow, they see. Else why set they lights, great Tapers before them? Or if they serve not; doe they not <hi>videre videntem omnia,</hi> see him who sees all things; Gods face is their looking glasse, they see all things in it.</p>
            <p>There is yet an other Saviour: not Gods, but mans, the Papists too. No neede to seeke so farre, to heaven for Saviours: theres one much neerer home: It is Merit. Goe no further than our selves. Our workes, our owne workes are Saviours sufficient. Almes, Fastings, Orysons, Pilgrimages, Vowes, and such like holy workes of supererogation suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to the saving both of our owne soules, and others. What neede we
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:173124:61"/> Saints? What neede we Christ? <hi>Bellarmine</hi> blusheth not to make our selves our Saviours. And he cites Saint <hi>Paul</hi> for it, <hi>Salutem vestram ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remini, worke ye your owne salvation.</hi> But Saint <hi>Peter</hi> saith, (whom I thought, hee would have rather heard) <hi>non est nomen aliud; there is none other name under heaven, by which we may be saved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude, both for Saints and Merits, but especially for Saints, they will say they make them Saviours; for the Fathers, even the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers say they are. But first, they slander them. Secondly, say they did; here is one <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Scripture is a part of the propheticall Antheme, sung by old <hi>Simeon</hi> at the <hi>Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi> of the <hi>Virgin Mary.</hi> The aged Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his young Saviour in his armes, openeth his mouth in thanksgiving unto him, who had given him a revelation by the holy Ghost, that hee should not see death, untill he saw the Lords Christ. The song standeth on three parts, a thankefull resignation of his life, a joyfull confession of the Saviour, and a wonderfull commendation of the <hi>Messias.</hi> The last of the three, is the tenour of my Text, consisting of two titles, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to Christs stile; <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the light of the Gentiles; and <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, the Glory of the Iewes; <hi>To be a light to lighten the Gentiles, and to be the Glory of thy People Israel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Should I not be censured for Curiosity, I would observe one thing in the order of the Titles. Why the <hi>Light</hi> of the Gentiles should be placed before the <hi>Glory</hi> of the Iewes. It is not my conceipt, but noted
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:173124:62"/> by the learned; that the sweet singer of this song guided by Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, doth put the Gentiles before the Iewes; because the second calling, the conversion of the Iewes to Christ, shall not be, untill the fulnesse of the Gentiles come; Saint <hi>Paul</hi> avoucheth it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 25. that their obstinacy shall continue till then: and then <hi>Totus Israel Salvabitur,</hi> all Israel shall be saved. But he termeth this a mystery: and therefore I will not meddle with it.</p>
            <p>The first title in my Text of the <hi>Messias</hi> honour, is, the <hi>Light of the Gentiles.</hi> The Lord in former ages shut up all nations in the shadow of death. The shine of his especiall mercies was seene onely of the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites. As all the land of <hi>Egypt</hi> was covered with blacke darkenesse; onely the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> had light, where they dwelt, <hi>Exod.</hi> 10. so spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall blackenesse had covered the face of all heathen lands, onely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Israel</hi> did the Lord let shine the bright luster of his Grace.</p>
            <p>The darkenesse of the Gentiles, was the ignorance of God, the sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of sinne, the tyranny of sathan, and subjection to death and hell. Ignorance is the blindenesse and the darkenesse of the minde. Sinne is the worke of darkenesse, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. Sathan is the prince of darkenesse. Death is the power of darkenesse, and hell is the pit of darkenesse. As godlinesse is called the <hi>armour of light, Rom.</hi> 13. so wickednesse is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>kingdome of darkenesse.</hi> And the Gentiles before Christ were subjects in this kingdome; Atheisme, Idolatry; nay their very ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, considered in themselves, out of Christ, were all but darkenesse. Themselves were darkenesse, for both their soules were clouded with errour, and their bodies instruments of sinne. Their workes were dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, all manner of licentiousnesse. Their King was darkenesse, for they served sathan; and their end was darkenesse; for they went to hell. But as when the day breaketh, the night vanisheth, and the Sun rising chaseth away darkenesse; so at Christs comming, whom <hi>Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> calleth the <hi>day breake. Luke</hi> 1. 78. light appeared: and at the rising of the <hi>Messias,</hi> whom the Prophet <hi>Malachie</hi> calleth <hi>the Sunne, Mal.</hi> 4. 2. all lands were enlightned. Errour and ignorance were chased out of heathen mindes. For the Preaching of the Gospell is the opening of the eies, <hi>Act. 26. 18. The eyes of the understanding.</hi> The pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ifying of their soules to be the seates of God, and the sanctifying of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to be the temples of the Holy Ghost, the remission of their sinnes, the amendment of their life, their rescue from sathan, and their ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some from hell, these were the gratious beames of that glorious Sunne, the Sonne of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Simeon</hi> foretelleth this, Christ being newly borne: that he should be <hi>a Light to lighten the Gentiles.</hi> Yea <hi>Zachary</hi> foretelleth it, before he was borne, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 79. that he should <hi>give light to them that sat in darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi> Nay <hi>Esay</hi> foretelleth it, before <hi>Zachary</hi> was borne. <hi>Esay</hi> 60. 3. that the nations should walke in his light, and Kings in the brightnesse of his rising. Nay <hi>David</hi> foretelleth it, before <hi>Esay</hi> was borne, <hi>in lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine tuo videbimus lumen, In thy light wee shall see light,</hi> that is, <hi>in Christo tuo, videbimus gratiam,</hi> in Gods annointed we shall see grace. Nay <hi>Balaam</hi> foretelleth it, before <hi>David</hi> was borne, <hi>Num.</hi> 24. 17. that there should come a <hi>Starre</hi> from <hi>Iacob.</hi>

            <p>The great largenesse of this goodly light shooteth forth his shine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all people, and is therefore called <hi>Iohn 8. 12. lux mundi,</hi> the worlds light. <hi>Balaam</hi> calleth him a Starre, and the starres give light unto the world; but that light is small; but Christ is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, a great light, <hi>Math.</hi> 4. 16. God made two of them, <hi>Gen. 1. 16. Luminarta magna, two great Lights,</hi> the Sunne and the Moone, a bigger and a lesse; and Christ is the greater of the two; so the Prophet <hi>Malachy</hi> calleth him, 4. 2. <hi>The Sunne of Righteousnesse; non Sol, ut stulte &amp; impie Manichaei, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustin. tract. 34 in Iohan. Balaam</hi> calleth him a starre, and were he no more then so, yet as the Starres give shine unto the night, so doth Christ give light to them that sit in darkenesse. But he is more then so, he is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the <hi>Sunne</hi> of righteousnesse; the starres give shine unto the night; but the Sunne turneth the night into day. Now if the Sunne be able to dart out his beames, to the hemisphere of the earth, which is but the halfe; how much more shall Christ shoot forth his grace un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the whole earth? For the Sunne howsoever it appeare not so bigge as a waggon wheele, yet it is farre greater then the whole earth. But Christ, howsoever he seemed in body no bigger than a man, yet in his Godhead he is farre greater then the whole world. For the heavens which are the enclosure of the whole world, are but his spanne, <hi>Esay</hi> 40. 12. And therefore that which <hi>Synesius</hi> said of the Sunne, is truer of Christ, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; <hi>nihil divinius, nihil commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius.</hi> If the Sunne shooteth forth his light unto all lands, Christ much more sheadeth forth his grace into all nations.</p>
            <p>The brightnesse of his light not any Angell of the earth can say, it hath not seene it. He that is <hi>Pater luminum, the Father of lights, Iam.</hi> 1. 17. and that dwelleth <hi>in lumine inaccessibili, in the light that none can attaine unto, 1 Tim.</hi> 6. yea that is himselfe light, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. the beames of his brightnesse cannot be so weake, as not to suffice to enlighten the whole world. If any see it not, they are such, whose eares the god of this world hath blinded. And yet his light is so piercing, that even they also see him. They see, but will not see; as the Prophet speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>videndo non vident, seeing they see not.</hi> They heare the Gospell, but entertaine it not; the word is preached, but they obey it not, grace is offered, but they accept it not, Gods promises are tendred, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend them not. Christs light unto such, is as the Sunne is to some Countries, it shines upon them, but it warmes them not. They that dwell in the uttermost climats of the earth, they see some light, but they feele no heat. So doe these, they see Christs light perforce; but the comfortable warmth of his gratious Spirit they feele it not.</p>
            <p>[That which the Metaphysicke Philosopher saith of <hi>bonum,</hi> to be <hi>diffusivum sui,</hi> it is as true of light; it is <hi>diffusivum sui,</hi> the nature of light is like to water shed, it runneth out every way, and speadeth it selfe on every side.] The Sunne no sooner riseth, but the light of his beames shooteth forth into the aire, and overspreadeth the face of the earth; The rising of this glorious light, the. Sonne of God presently enlightened the whole world. <hi>The lightning</hi> saith Christ <hi>commeth out of the East, and shineth into the West, so also shall the comming of the Son of man be, Math.</hi> 24. 27. Christ said it of his second comming, his
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:173124:63"/> comming in the Clouds; it is as true of his first comming, his comming in the flesh; for like unto the lightning, he came out of the East, but he shone into the West. His <hi>Incarnation</hi> was in <hi>Iudaea,</hi> but his <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> shone into the Westerne world. For as the lightning glideth from the one side of Heaven unto the other; so the Gospell glaunceth from one side of the earth unto the other. And it is Christs lanterne to beare his light before his people; it is his torch, lighted at the beames of the Sunne shine of his grace, to direct the footesteps of the Gentiles to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward heaven.</p>
            <p>As King <hi>Assuerus</hi> sent out his posts into all provinces, so <hi>Christ</hi> hath sent forth his Apostles into all realmes. His raigne was from <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> unto the East <hi>Indies.</hi> His <hi>Ite, praedicate, goe and Preach,</hi> is unto all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Math.</hi> 28. 19. Not onely <hi>Greekeland,</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> the <hi>Dutch,</hi> the <hi>French,</hi> the <hi>English,</hi> and the <hi>Spanish,</hi> have long enjoyed the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his light; but the goodly lampe of his glorious Gospell was both long agoe, and is now againe of late borne over the West Ocean into the new world.</p>
            <p>The light I say is <hi>diffusivum sui.</hi> In ages past God put his candle un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a bushell; or at the most, he set it but upon a table, and it gave light onely to them of his house. The Iewes alone were of his house; the Gentiles aliens and strangers, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 12. But after Christs comming the light brake forth, and suddenly shined into all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</p>
            <p>What then, you will say unto me, had the Gentiles indeed no light before? surely they had some, such as it was, but a very dimme light; onely the light of nature. He revealed to the Heathen, his power, his wisedome, his goodnesse, and the rest of his Divinity, <hi>non per Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turam, sed per naturam,</hi> not by the Scriptures, but by the Creatures. The wonderfull workemanship of Heaven and earth, though both of them dumb, Preached unto them, what God was. But this light was but twy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. It was but as starre light. I say, the light of the Gentiles was as a starre; as the day-starre in the morning; which rising a little before the Sunne, bringeth some light with him, but a weake light; because it comes <hi>ab imo,</hi> from below. But Christs rising is <hi>ab alto. Luke</hi> 1. 78. from above, and therefore a full light. The light of nature, take it at the best; is but as the light when the day dawneth: but Christs light of Grace, meant here by old <hi>Symeon,</hi> is as the Sunneshine at mid-day. The morning light, before the Sunne is up, is nothing but shade; yea when it is in rising, every low shrub maketh a great shaddow; but when the Sunne is mounted, then the light is perfect; and the higher the Sunne, the lesser the shaddow. Yea when it commeth to the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, it hath little or no shaddow, no shaddow at all, where it is Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall.</p>
            <p>To shut up this first part; the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were once darkenesse, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 8. The promises were made unto the Patriarkes, not unto the Gentiles, the Gentiles were but dogges, the Iewes onely Gods children, <hi>Math.</hi> 15. 26.

            <p>The other honourable title given by <hi>Symeon</hi> unto Christ, is, the glory of the <hi>Iewes; To be a light to lighten the Gentiles, and to be the glory of his people Israel.</hi> There were foure things wherein the <hi>Iewes</hi> did glory, the <hi>Arke,</hi> the <hi>Law,</hi> the <hi>Temple,</hi> and the <hi>Covenant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the first, the <hi>Arke</hi> was the token of Gods presence, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of <hi>Israel.</hi> Their safe conduct over <hi>Iordan;</hi> it stood still, while the people went thorow the channell of the river on drie foote. <hi>David</hi> calleth it Gods strength, <hi>Psal. 105. 4. Dagon</hi> the Philistims god could not stand beside it, but fell twice from his place, and broke both his hands and his head. The men of <hi>Ashdod</hi> were smitten with <hi>Emor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roides,</hi> and the <hi>Eckronites</hi> plagued for holding it from <hi>Israel. Obed Edoms</hi> house was blessed for giving it house-roome. <hi>David,</hi> though he were a King, yet disdained not to daunce before it, and received it into his city with great triumph and solemnitie. When it was taken of the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stims, the griefe was so great both of <hi>Ely</hi> the Priest, and his daughter in in Law bigge with child, that at the sudden newes, the old man fell backward from his stoole, and brake his necke; and the young wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man travelled before her time; and though she was delivered of a man child, which commonly is a comfort to a woman in her paines, and the women about her, bad her not feare, for she had borne a sonne, yet she would not be comforted, but cried out, <hi>the glory is departed from Israel.</hi> Yea, she set her sorrow in her childs name, she called him <hi>Icabod,</hi> that is, <hi>non est gloria,</hi> and cried out againe, <hi>the glory is departed from Israel, 1 Sam. 4. ult.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the second, the <hi>Temple;</hi> the great Temple of <hi>Diana</hi> at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> reckoned one of the seven wonders of the world, that was two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares in building, and had sixscore pillars, founded by as many Kings: The Temple of <hi>Constantinople</hi> which was called for the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the beautie of the world; but the Prophet calleth the Temple of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> the <hi>Lords beautie, Psal.</hi> 78. 61. as the <hi>Arke</hi> was his strength, so the <hi>Temple</hi> was his beautie, the perfection, the complement of beautie, <hi>Psal.</hi> 50. 2. were not so famous as the Temple of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> a worke so sumptuous and glorious, that men of all Nations came from the uttermost parts of the earth to see it. The doores, the tables, and the Altars, plated with gold; the ground paved, the walls lined, and the roofe seeled with gold: yea all the Vtensills, the Lampes, the Snuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, and the Candlestickes, the Spoones, the Basons, and the Ash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pannes, and the instruments of musicke, all of pure gold; the Cherubims,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:173124:64"/> the Pomegranats, and all the carved worke, overlaid with Gold, yea the worke of the pavement in the inward sanctuary, inlaid with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious stone; beside all the vessels of silver and brasse, the iron worke, the wood and the stone of inestimable worth. And to make it yet more honourable, the Lord vouchsafed to call it his house, <hi>Esa.</hi> 56. 7. his residence <hi>Psalme</hi> 13. there set he his Arke, his Oracle, and his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy seate.</p>
            <p>For the third, the <hi>Law;</hi> the <hi>Athenians</hi> brag of <hi>Solon,</hi> and the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codaemonians</hi> of <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> that they devised their lawes. Much better might the <hi>Iewes</hi> glory in their Law; for it came from Heaven. A reason which the Turkes thinke very sufficient to authorise their <hi>Alcoran;</hi> for so their lying <hi>Mahomet</hi> made them beleeve. But <hi>Israel</hi> indeed had their law from Heaven; it is the ordinance of Angels, <hi>Act.</hi> 7. 53. and Gods owne handwriting. <hi>Deut.</hi> 10. and therefore very worthily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred by <hi>Moses,</hi> before the lawes of all other nations <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> 4. 8.</p>
            <p>For these three things, the <hi>Israelites</hi> lifted themselves above the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> as indeed they might. And they accounted them their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. But the fourth excels them all, and that is the <hi>Covenant,</hi> a mutuall stipulation betweene the Lord and them, that he would be their God, and they should be his people, he <hi>Israels</hi> God, and they Gods <hi>Israel. Symeon</hi> hath put them both into my Text, and both are their glory; both the name of <hi>Israel,</hi> and that they are Gods people. For the one, it is an honourable name, given <hi>Iacob</hi> by the Angell, and▪ signifieth one that had <hi>prevaild with God.</hi> And to this day, if you speake to a Iew; though the name of a Iew be taken from <hi>Iudah,</hi> the noblest tribe of all the twelve, yet you please him much better, and grace him much more if you call him an <hi>Israelite.</hi> For the other, what glory can be greater, then to be Gods people? and therefore the Lord, when hee would disgrace <hi>Israel</hi> for their demerits, bad the Prophet <hi>Hosea</hi> to call his Sonnes name, <hi>Lo-ammi, id est, Yee are not my People, Hosea</hi> 1. 9.</p>
            <p>For this Covenant sake, because God made it first with <hi>Abraham,</hi> they brag of their descent from him, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8. 33. We be <hi>Abrahams seed,</hi> and 39. <hi>We have Abraham to our Father.</hi> Yea that gracious Covenant gave them infinite matter to glory in their God; who had chosen them above all nations to be his people, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

When they hungred, Heaven raigned foules, and the Lord fed them with the bread of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. To doe them right, Kings were reprooved, and to make them roome, nations were expelled. He fought their battailes, and discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitted the heathen; yea the starres from heaven fought for his people, and the Sunne stood still, while they were avenged on their enemies. When they cryed, his bowels earned, and their distresse was a wound unto his Soule. As the henne doth her young, so he brooded them, and bore them on his wings, as the young Eagles.</p>
            <p>

Hee maketh there a generall muster of all the Iewes prerogatives, but the first is it, the Adoption, not <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, the law, but <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the Gospell, the embassage of Adoption. Surely as <hi>David</hi> saith of <hi>Ierusalem, Very excellent things are spoken of thee, Oh thou City of God:</hi> so I will say of <hi>Israel,</hi> very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent things are spoken of thee, Oh thou people of God. But all their excellencies are exceld of this, to be adopted of God through Christ. All their other glories were but earthly and temporall; this is heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and spirituall. The <hi>Arke</hi> and the <hi>Temple,</hi> and the <hi>Law,</hi> the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and the Lords protection in all their distresses, they were indeed the honour and the glory of <hi>Israel.</hi> But their maine glory, the glory of their glory, was the <hi>Messias.</hi> To have Christ their kinsman, descended from <hi>David,</hi> from <hi>Israel,</hi> from <hi>Abraham,</hi> after the flesh; that glory was so great, as could not be paralleld by all the nations up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth; but to have him their brother by the adoption of God, the redeemer of their Soules, is a glory farre more excellent. And in res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of that <hi>David</hi> might well say, <hi>non sic fecitulli nationi, Psalme</hi> 20. The blessed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> at the message of the Angell, that shee should beare Christ, set aside all other argument of glorying and joy, and her spirit exulted, her soule rejoyced in God her Saviour.</p>
            <p>The light of the Sunne, the breath of life, the fruites of the earth, and such other common benefits, the Gentiles ever enjoyed as well as the Iewes: but the blessing which was to be hoped for in Christ was alwaies resiant in the house of <hi>Abraham.</hi> It is Christs owne speech, <hi>John. 4. 22. Salvation is of the Iewes.</hi> The Iewes have good cause to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in <hi>Abraham,</hi> as I shewed before, they did; for he was the Father of the faithfull, <hi>Rom. 4. the friend of God, Iames</hi> 2. and his bosome the blessed receptacle of the Saints deceased. But better may they glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, if they consider Christ; who was promised to <hi>Abraham,</hi> when God assured him, <hi>That in his seed all nations should be blessed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Prophet <hi>Haggai,</hi> meant this glory, <hi>cap.</hi> 2. 10. when hee said, <hi>That the glory of the last house should be greater then the first.</hi> For else the second temple was lesse glorious then the first by many degrees; and nothing in comparison of it, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. But the Lord by one second house meaneth the <hi>Messias,</hi> whose manhood, was the temple of his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, as our bodies are called the temples of the Holy Ghost; and in that place hee promiseth to give peace; for Christ is our peace.</p>
            <p>To shut up this second title; God sent his Sonne unto the Iewes for his Covenants sake, but to the Gentiles for his Compassions sake. His promise enforced him to keepe his truth with them, but meere mercy induced him to reach his grace to us. His mercy and his truth are united in my Text; and as <hi>David</hi> singeth <hi>Psalme 85. 10. Misericordia &amp; ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritas obviaverunt sibi, Mercy and truth are</hi> here <hi>met together,</hi> this Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall Prophet, for so I may terme <hi>Symeon,</hi> for the forme of his speech is Prophecy, but the matter is Gospell; proclaimeth the <hi>Messias,</hi> that
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:173124:65"/> he should be, as <hi>a light unto the Gentiles,</hi> so a glory to the Iewes; not a glory of admiration, as was their <hi>Arke</hi> an amazement to the <hi>Philistims,</hi> and their <hi>Temple</hi> a wonderment to the world, and the <hi>Covenant</hi> of Gods Protection, an astonishment to all people. I say, not a glory of admiration, but a glory of Salvation: for so it is in the verse before. Their transgression of Gods law, their heathenish idolatry, their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny murmurings against God, their distrust of his providence, their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse of his benefits, their unthankefullnesse, and all their wickednesse, had put them out of Gods protection, enwrapped them in the wreathes of sinne, enfolded them in the curse of God, and enthralled them to death, to sathan, and to hell. Neither <hi>Arke,</hi> nor <hi>Law,</hi> nor <hi>Temple,</hi> nor any thing, in which they trusted, in which they gloryed, could set them free. But Christ was come for that purpose. They were lost, and he came to save that which was lost; Christ was now come and with him Salvation. His mighty conquest of their spirituall enemies should give them ample matter of Glory: and so it did, both to them, and us, who now are <hi>Israel</hi> as well as they, not <hi>successione carnis,</hi> but <hi>haereditate fidei, Hilar.</hi> and sonnes to <hi>Abraham,</hi> as well as they, who is the Father <hi>omnium credentium,</hi> of all beleevers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Christ</hi> hath vanquished sinne; the Lambe of God hath taken away the sinnes of the world? He hath borne them in his body upon the tree; so that they shall not be imputed unto us; and instead of them hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us his righteousnesse, by which we stand accepted before God. And he hath conquered death by his resurrection; that though we die still, yet now death is no curse, but a passage into Heaven. And he hath broken the gates of hell. And hee hath subdued sathan; the womans seed hath bruised the Serpents head, <hi>peremit Serpens, redemit Christus. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

            <p>My text needs not <hi>Analysis,</hi> beares none well, in so few words. The former terme is a Metaphor; how diversly glossed by Expositors, twere idle to recite. Of sixe sundrie senses I select two: <hi>Signum,</hi> to meane here either <hi>Scopum,</hi> or <hi>Vexillum,</hi> the Archers marke, or the Banner in warre.

Christ is <hi>a Signe,</hi> an Ensigne, for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very souldier of Sathans to fight against. Christ is <hi>a Signe,</hi> a Marke, for every blasphemer to aime his arrowes at. This latter Metaphor <hi>Tolet</hi> rejects, saith the word beares it not. I thinke because <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> so expound it.

            <p>Adde to Christs Death, his Resurrection. In it Christ was a Signe of contradiction in the proper sense; not of exprobration onely, as in his Death.

The Priests therefore and Elders bad the souldiers say, Christs corpse was stolen by night out of the grave. And Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> saith, the Iewes said so to that day. I marvell not; they say so to this day. Neither marvell I at that. Some of Christs owne disciples doubted of that point, Christs Resurrection. What say I some? All did. So seeme Saint <hi>Marke</hi> and Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> both to say. Indeede to doubt, is not to contradict. But one of them said flatly, <hi>Non credam, Thomas</hi> did. Thats a contradiction; as much as <hi>Non resurrexit,</hi> Christ is not risen. The <hi>Albigenses</hi> onely I finde in the Church Historie to be opposites in this point.</p>

            <p>But how comes sathan to be a promiser? Promise is properly of good things, Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith. The devill soloeciseth, when hee promiseth: for from him can come no good. Sathan may say, he will: but what? He will entise. I will be a false Spirit in the Prophets mouthes. Of such things he may say, he will. But to give, to give king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, or ought els, that good is, he can not: tis not in his power. Nay indeed it is not in his will; though he say it. I will ascend up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heaven, and raise my throne above the starres, I will sit on the sides of the North, and be equall to the most Highest. Sathan may say of this, he will; say so of any <hi>Sinne.</hi> But to will good, any good, any good to any man, sathan will not say it. Say it, he may: but he will not doe it.

But the devill is Gods opposite in all things, in this specially, in his Word. God never breakes it, sathan never keepes it. Christ cals him <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a <hi>Lyer.</hi> Tis a worne proverbe in every mans mouth, in every childes mouth, as false as the devill. If he give, he gives the wrong, for bread a stone; for a fish, a scorpion. <hi>Eve</hi> found it. He promist life; but it prooved death. Then he deceived the Woman: now he would faine deceive the seed of the Woman. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, the World, <hi>semper falli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>To end this, I <hi>will give,</hi> saith the devill, Christ must belike trust sathan on his Word. A Lyar on his Word? What is a promise in a leasers lippes? Promises are vaine, <hi>verba dum sunt,</hi> where the persons credit is crackt, that promises. <hi>Promisit, qui non mentitur,</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith of God, he promises, that lies not. The devils <hi>daboes</hi> are but
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:173124:70"/> weake, unlesse he were more trie of truth. Sathan had said something, had the tense beene present, had he said, I give. I doe, is actuall; I will doe, is uncertaine. <hi>Dabo</hi> is but lanke, in a ranke liers mouth; and tis but a bare <hi>Dabo</hi> too, without either Oath, or any Protestation. The devill in this, honester than man, than many men: who will bind with Oathes those promises, which they never meane to keepe. Sathan will lie, but he will not sweare too. See how the subtill Sophister takes advantage of the tense: (the <hi>Will</hi> hath a wile in it) suspends the gift, till the service be performed; craves the condition first; cares not for Christs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of breach of promise. Let him sue him, if hee will, upon As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumpsit. Christ having worshipt him, he hath that hee would. Christ hath done an Act, can not be undone. He would up to God presently, and say, heres he, they call thy Sonne; he hath worshipt me. By it hee should see, he was not the Sonne of God, the onely drift of his temta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; as you may see by the two first Acts of it. Let Christ then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postulate for his beguiling him; he would say, <hi>Tu videris,</hi> looke to that himselfe: Enough of this.</p>
            <p>Sathan will: What will he? Hee will give. <hi>All these will I give thee.</hi> Tis not <hi>locatio,</hi> a demising them, aletting them to Farme; tis <hi>Datio,</hi> a gift. Not <hi>venundatio,</hi> a sale for money; as <hi>Iudas</hi> gave Christ: <hi>Quid dabitis, what will you give me, and I will deliver him;</hi>

That we doe to God, for the things we have from him: and yet we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, he gives them freely. Wicked impostor! calls he this a gift?

The cheapest of his gifts, costs the dearest thing man hath: he must give his soule for it; soule and body both. <hi>Vix Priamus tanti,</hi> his Kingdomes, all his kingdomes are not worth a soule. Christ saith it, who well knew the price of soules: for he bought many. Hee saith, that hee that winnes the world, losing his soule, gaines not by the bargaine. To worship Sathan, soone said, soone done. But the sequell of it, the sale, the whole sale of my selfe: I become Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans slave. That which he calls a gift, costs me all I have, all I am, bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and soule. <hi>Imitantur hamos dona,</hi> gifts are but hookes, saith <hi>Martial;</hi> the devills gifts, deadly hookes; Christ in Sibils <hi>Achrosticha</hi> is called <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, a Fish. Sathan comes here angling; baites his hooke with king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, hoping, if he would but bite, to have him his.</p>
            <p>Mens gifts, many are dangerous, meerely insiduous; the Receiver is enthrall'd, <hi>libertatem vendidit,</hi> Much more, Sathans.

            <p>Sathan will give? What will hee give? Sathan is not sordid, profers no base things: he will give kingdomes. Gifts should beseeme (<hi>Isocrates</hi> saith) <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, both the giver and the receiver. Sathan is a

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the great Monarke of the world. He therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises <hi>Basilicè</hi> like a King. Nay Kings can not give, what Sathan here promises. They may bestow great honours, Earledomes, Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes; but not Kingdomes. If they give them away; they are no Kings. <hi>Assuerus</hi> promised <hi>Hester,</hi> and <hi>Herod</hi> his step-daughter, the halfe of their Kingdomes, if they askt it. But whole Kingdomes, Kings can not give, and keepe them too. It must be a power paramont to Kings, transcending regall power; some <hi>Dominus Dominantium,</hi> Lord of Lords, as the Turkish <hi>Sultan</hi> stiles himselfe; some <hi>Rex Regum,</hi> King of Kings, as the Emperour of <hi>Canstantinople</hi> was wont to beare foure B's in his Scocheon, foure Greeke B's, in every quarter one: mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that he was <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a King of Kings, raigning over all that raigne. Such a one is Sathan. Himselfe saith it, <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 6. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that those kingdomes are all his, and hee can give them at his pleasure; What neede wee doubt it of the devill, when wee see it in the Pope? Even he assumes the power of giving Kingdomes. Will you heare himselfe speake, just in the devills Dialect? <hi>Imperium nostrum est,</hi> saith Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> IV. <hi>Damus, cui volumus,</hi> the Empire is ours, to give to whom we please.</p>
            <p>Crownes are in his hands, nay in his feete; his basest limbe can make an Emperour. His foote can crowne them, and uncrowne them too, kicke it off againe if he list. Aske not, <hi>Quo warranto,</hi> by what authoritie? Sathan saith, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>▪ So doth the Pope; tis a <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a Tradition. Thats enough: Scripture skills not; <hi>Traditio est.</hi> He hath it from <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine:</hi> his Donation registred in the Canon law. Heretickes call it a counterfeit. But looke on the inscription; there is <hi>Palaea, i.</hi> ancient, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Vnlearned <hi>Calvinists</hi> read it <hi>Palea;</hi> as though the Law had cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd it for chaffe. The kingdome of <hi>Sicily, Naples,</hi> and all <hi>Italy, France, Spaine,</hi> &amp; <hi>Germanie,</hi> great <hi>Britaine</hi> too, the whole Westerne world is by that antient deed of gift conveigh'd unto the Pope. A large gift. <hi>Lu.</hi> calls it a large lie, <hi>Ingens mendacium.</hi> But hee was an <hi>Apostata.</hi> Some Papists too censure it, of good ranke and learning: but belike false brethren. This point, I should digresse too farre, to dispute it with the Pope.</p>
            <p>To returne then, Sathan give Kingdomes? Hee hath none to give. Surely one he hath; but not to give. <hi>Nazianzen</hi> calls him <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. So doth Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> Christ calls him a prince too. But his kingdome is spirituall, in the hearts of unbeleevers. It is stated in his person onely, can not be made over unto any. These worldly Kingdomes, which he promised Christ, are none of his, either to give to others or to hold himselfe. Tis a double lie, in that place of Saint <hi>Luke;</hi> both that he can give them; and that they are given him. Hee hath neither <hi>Diti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem,</hi> nor <hi>Dationem,</hi> neither right to raigne, nor power to give. Tis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed (as he termes it) a <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a tradition: but like to those of the Popes. Their traditions lies; so his a meere coggerie.</p>
            <p>Tis God gives kingdomes; gives indeed all things. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Every gift is from above;</hi> Kingdomes especially. <hi>Per me Reges regnant,</hi> Kings raigne by God. Tis God (saith <hi>Daniel</hi>) sets up Kings. A watchman cries from heaven, that it is the most highest, that hath power over king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, and gives them unto whom he will. God therefore calls Kings,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:173124:71"/> His. <hi>I have set my King,</hi> saith God, meaning of <hi>David.</hi> Twas a proud phrase of the Cardinals, <hi>Ego &amp; Rex meus,</hi> I and my King: the Pope could say no more. <hi>There is no Power</hi> (Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith) <hi>but</hi> tis <hi>of God;</hi> Regall power specially. All Kings are <hi>Christi Dei,</hi> Gods annointed. <hi>Saul</hi> a wicked man, <hi>Cyrus</hi> an Heathen, <hi>David</hi> cals the one, Gods selfe the other, his annointed. <hi>David</hi> saith it of himselfe, <hi>Dominus elegit me,</hi> tels <hi>Michal,</hi> God had chosen him: <hi>Solomon</hi> of himselfe, <hi>Tu reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nare fecisti,</hi> saith God had made him King: All Kings confesse it, put it in their style; <hi>Iacobus Dei gratia,</hi> that they owe their Kingdomes to the grace of God.</p>
            <p>Sathan is yet more francke. Tis much to give a Kingdome, one Kingdome: he will give multitudes. Sathan knew by himselfe, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition hath no bounds. At <hi>Rome</hi> three Crownes are upon one Head. Christ might have haply an aspiring spirit; sathan will fit him. Nor was the devill ignorant, that Christ was a King borne, <hi>King of the Iewes.</hi> The wise men knew it by the starre, sathan much more, knew <hi>Herod</hi> but usurpt; the right was Christs. He would not therefore offer it, it onely: thought it would not moove him; showed him therefore ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, profferd them <hi>All.</hi> God once made <hi>Abraham</hi> the like promise, bad him looke North and South, East and West; and all the land he saw, he would give unto his seed. <hi>Dixit &amp; factum est,</hi> he said it, and he did it. For he is <hi>verax in promissione, &amp; potens in exhibitione, Bern.</hi> as able to performe, as franke to promise. But in Man, and more in sathan, the largenesse of his promise prejudicates his truth, is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption he meanes falsely. <hi>Largissimi Promissores</hi> be <hi>parcissimi exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitores,</hi> saith the same Father, they performe least, that promise large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liest.</p>
            <p>Kingdomes are no common gifts, whole Kingdomes. Theres one in the Gospell, gives Cities to his servants, ten to one, five to another. Or because thats but a Parable, <hi>Solomon</hi> gave certaine Cities to King <hi>Hiram.</hi> Say some great Emperour, Lord of many Realmes, resigne some one unto his Sonne. Heeres one so bountifull, that hee gives a World of Kingdomes, promises to give. One that himselfe hath not, not a Kingdome onely, but not a Province, not a Towne, not a House, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

            <p>All the Kingdomes of the World? an unreasonable promise, saith Saint <hi>Chrysostome.</hi> All to one? Then must he take them from the ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, unthrone them, to enthronise him; spoile many, to grace one. So while he sought to be worshipped of one, he would be despised of multitudes. Nor is man on earth, like the sunne in Heaven, one en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough for the whole world.</p>

               </gap> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, a Method in deceipt. Sathan hath it, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith too. First he assaies Christ with distrust: that Temptation takes not. Then with presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that failes too. Two darts, two fiery darts of the devill, one of them lightly wont to speed. Christ with the shield of Scripture quencht them both. Avarice is his <hi>Achilleum,</hi> that never misseth; that hee uses last. Theres none whom that Temptation takes not, tickles not at least. <hi>Quid dabis,</hi> what will you give me, every mans question, not <hi>Iudas</hi> onely. <hi>Peter</hi> askt it of Christ, <hi>What shall wee have? Abraham</hi> askt it of God, <hi>What wilt thou give me?</hi> Kingdomes, and their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitants are a baite, which sathan doubted not, but Christ being Flesh and blood, could not but bite. I call it Avarice from many Authors. That lust is not of money onely, as the etymon implies, <hi>Avarus, i. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidus aeris;</hi> but tis also <hi>Altitudinis,</hi> saith <hi>Gregory,</hi> desire of honour. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> too, tis (hee saith) in all things coveted inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately.</p>
            <p>To end this; tis All, but all <hi>these,</hi> all the Kingdomes of the <hi>Earth.</hi> He presumes not to proffer him the Kingdome of Heaven. The devill more moderate then the Pope. He would promise unto one, that would blow up a Parliament house, or that would but kill a King, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heaven.</p>
            <p>Come we now to the Condition. This profuse Promiser, <hi>Quid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feret,</hi> what lookes he for? We have heard, what he will give; let us heare what he will have. He profers largely: but upon what termes? Christ must <hi>fall downe</hi> and <hi>worship</hi> him. The devill knew, Ambition was a strong lust, would stoope low, to rise high. None more base minded, then the proud. <hi>Quid iniquitatis,</hi> saith the Oratour, what wrong, what indignity will not a man beare, in the hope of an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Haply but of a little land, or summe of money, and but the hope of them? How then will the gift, the present possession of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome move a man? of many, of all the kingdomes in the world? What will he not doe, what will he not suffer, to receive it? <hi>Imperia pretio quolibet constant benè,</hi> saith <hi>Polynices</hi> in the Tragedy. A Crowne is not deare, at any price. <hi>Occidat, modò imperet,</hi> let my Sonne kill me, so he may be Emperour, saith <hi>Neroes</hi> Mother. Shed blood, any blood; kneele to <hi>Baal, Regnandi, gratia,</hi> saith <hi>Caesar,</hi> neither <hi>Ius,</hi> nor <hi>Fas,</hi> will be regarded. Lust of soveraignty dispenseth with all lawes, of Man, of God, of Nature, <hi>Omnibus flagrantior,</hi> saith <hi>Tacitus,</hi> the most fierce, most fiery, most furious of all lusts.</p>
            <p>Surely sathan thought Christ, though not the Sonne of God, yet a very holy man: yet doubted not but Dignity, Soveraignty, such So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty would be lure sufficient to draw his lust: yea though the Son of God, Himselfe sometimes, a Sonne of Gods too, while he was a good Angell, yet had felt the force of that Temptation. To raise his throne above the starres, and to be equall to the most highest, hee would venture a fall even into hell. <hi>Abimeleck</hi> to be King, will slay all his Brethren. <hi>Athaliah</hi> to be Queene, all of the Blood-royall. <hi>Herod</hi> in feare to loose his Crowne, made a massacre of all the male infants in
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:173124:72"/>
               <hi>Bethleem. Absalon</hi> to raigne, will rebell against his Father. That a Spanish head may weare the English Crowne, the Iesuites will blow up the Parliament House with Gunpowder. Christ for so many Crownes, sathan hopes would be wonne to fall downe, and worship <hi>him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First to <hi>Fall downe.</hi> Prostration is a gesture used in Adoration in the Easterne Countries, in the worship either of God or Kings; to humble the whole body, to fall flat on the face unto the ground. <hi>David</hi> did it to <hi>Ionathan,</hi> though but the Kings Sonne. The devill before was not so prodigall, but now he is as proud. Great men are gratious, but they are as fastuous: they will show great favours; but they will looke for as large service. Bounty expects duty. Sathan will <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; but Christ must first <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, sathan will raise him up, but first hee must fall downe.</p>
            <p>An impudent demand, consider <hi>Quis, Cui,</hi> compare the Persons. Sathan, who (saith <hi>Ignatius</hi>) is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a Creature to be tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled under Christs feet, heere to crave, Christ to fall downe at <hi>his</hi> feet. Whom God sentenc't in the serpent to creepe on his belly on the ground, have Christ prostrate to <hi>him</hi> with his face unto the ground. Say sathan be a Lion, Saint <hi>Peter</hi> cals him so: Christ is a Lion too, the <hi>Revelation</hi> cals him so. Must sathan be a Lion saliant before Christ, and Christ be but a Lion couchant before him, crouchant before him. You may heere see, from what spirit he spake, that setting his foot on the necke of the Emperour, cryed <hi>Ambulabo super Aspidem,</hi> he would tread the Lion under his feet. Sathans pride heere is greater, then at his first fall. There hee said but <hi>Ero similis,</hi> I will be <hi>equall</hi> to the Highest: heere he will be superiour. Christ, who is God, must fall downe before him. As proud heere as Antichrist, who <hi>exalts himselfe</hi> (saith <hi>Paul) above</hi> him, <hi>that is called God. Haman</hi> is called proud, <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbissimus,</hi> the most proud; yet would he have beene content to have had but <hi>Mordecaies</hi> knee. Sathan is not satisfied, that Christ should onely bow to him; hee must fall <hi>downe</hi> to him, prostrate his whole body.</p>
            <p>Nay that will not serve neither; he must adore him too. The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell forbad Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> forbad him twise, to worship him. Divine adoration the blessed Spirit denies it, the damned fiend desires it.</p>
            <p>The devill is Gods <hi>Aemulus</hi> in every thing. In his name; the spirit raised by the Witch of <hi>Endor,</hi> is cald <hi>Elohim, i.</hi> God. In his wonders God turned a rod into a serpent, waters into blood, and smote the land with frogs. Sathan did the same by <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Sorcerers. In his prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative; God gives (saith <hi>Daniel</hi>) Kingdomes at his pleasure. So does sathan; saith, h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> does. In his worship; <hi>Come,</hi> saith the <hi>Psalmist, let us worship, fall downe, and kneele before the Lord.</hi> So sathan will have Christ to fall downe, and worship him; <hi>Latro divinae gloriae,</hi> an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptor of Gods glory. God saith, he <hi>will not give his glory to another.</hi> Sathan will take it, though he give it not. The homage proper to the blessed God of Heaven, impudently claimed by a cursed fiend of hell. [Vnto whom, and to his Angels belongs shame and confusion: but

He had rebuk'd his fellow for his blasphemie, acknowledg'd himselfe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of death, confest Christ innocent, and prayed to him for mercie, done all things that a Christian should doe, to be saved, both for Faith and Workes, a Christian in his case; Christ graciously answers him, <hi>To day thou shalt be with me in Paradise.</hi> A rich reward for so short a service, as God said to <hi>Abraham,</hi> an exceeding great reward.</p>
            <p>Fellowship with Christ, and that in heaven, even that very day. Foure points observable, remarkeable; Who? A sinnefull man. To <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> be with whom? With Christ, the Sonne of God. Where? In Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> in heaven. When? Immediately, To day. <hi>O altitudo,</hi> Oh the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> hight, oh the depth, oh the infinite <hi>Abyssus</hi> of the bowels of <hi>Christ Jesus!</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The disparitie of the persons, the hight and haste of the advancement, is not to be parallel'd in all the holy Scripture. God blesse it, to the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the poore despairing soule, if here be any such, to the hope of his salvation. I humbly pray Gods assistance and your patience.</p>
            <p>The first of the foure Questions is <hi>Quis,</hi> Who? For his Name. I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> pray pardon. I finde it in some Writers, but not classicall, and his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, and the souldiers too, that pierst Christs side, and the three Wise men, that came to worship Christ. Idle curiositie. The Scripture hath supprest them all. But I aske <hi>Quis,</hi> of his qualitie. Christs speech might presume some Prophet, some Apostle, some especiall holy man,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:173124:73"/> no ordinary person. What could Christ have said more to <hi>Moses,</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to <hi>Symeon,</hi> to his owne mother? This man is a sinner; not that onely, so were they, but a great sinner. All sinnes are not equall, as lying Papists say, we say. There are <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Ignorances, negligences, trippes, and slippes, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Saint <hi>Iames</hi> his terme. Some but <hi>Ore tenus,</hi> in Word onely, some but <hi>Corde tenus,</hi> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in thought; his was in Act, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, an evill Doer, a Malefactor, Saint <hi>Lukes</hi> terme. Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> is more plaine, and Saint <hi>Marke</hi> too, a Theefe. Worse indeed; the English word is too easie: a Robber; so is the Originall. Worse haply yet, a Murtherer too. So the Fathers glosse the place, and his execution makes it probable; a lawlesse man, <hi>Esays</hi> word <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; a man of <hi>Belial; Cruentus,</hi> S. <hi>Austins</hi> word, a man of bloud. S. <hi>Greg.</hi> aggravates it worse yet, brothers bloud, a Parricide. And is Paradise a place for such an one? Such a fellow fit to be with Christ? Saith not Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> theres no communion betweene <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>Belial?</hi> Yea for his particular sinne; say, it was but Theft; saith not Saint <hi>Paul</hi> too, Theeves shall not enter into heaven. We may therefore wonder, when he prayed Christ, remember him, that his answer was not, <hi>Quid mihi &amp; tibi?</hi> Fellow, what have I to doe with thee? He once answered his owne mother so. Christ in the <hi>Revelation</hi> appoints another place for Murtherers; not Paradise, but hell; the lake of fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome.</p>
            <p>But Grace is Gods, to give, where hee thinkes good; and the Spirit breathes into what brest he pleaseth. To this Theefe, this Robber, God is pleased to be gracious. His Spirit breaths saving faith into his brest. It layes hold on Christ, on Christ crucified. Never came sinner to Christ in better season. That faith wrought instantly repentance; and mercie pardoned his sinnes. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> lied not, when he said, Theeves shall not come in heaven. This man now is no Theefe before God. Christ takes his sinne on him; gives him his righteousnesse. On that robe God looking, reposeth his deceased soule among the Saints. Christ hath discharged his debt; Gods Iustice is satisfied, can not grudge him that mercy, which grace hath granted him. Else as men arrest the dead bodies of their debtors, nor will let them to be buried: so Sathan, prince of the Aire, would not suffer a Theeves soule to passe by him into Paradise. Idolaters, Adulterers, Theeves, Murtherers, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortioners shall not come into Gods Kingdome Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, said truely. But many, that have beene sinners in those kindes, or others, but have repented, have come thither. Else <hi>David,</hi> whom Saint <hi>Paul</hi> reckons among the Saints; <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 32. should be among the damned; and Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> the one a persecuter, the other a forswearer; and who not?</p>
            <p>Not great crimes onely, but the lightest sinnes suffice to damne, if God forgive not. Hell should have all; heaven none but Angells. Christ here on the Crosse suffered for all sinners. Not light offenders onely, as <hi>Moses,</hi> who spake but onely unadvisedly; <hi>Ionas,</hi> that was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie at Gods mercie; <hi>Zacharie,</hi> that beleeved not the Angell: but <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> an Idolater, the woman that washt Christs feete, thought an Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teresse, <hi>Manasses</hi> the most wicked of all the Kings of <hi>Iudah;</hi> God first
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:173124:74"/> hath given them grace, and then forgiven their sinnes, and at last saved their soules. Heaven hath many Saints, who on earth have beene great sinners.</p>
            <p>The use of this, is mans comfort, and Gods praise. Be thy sinne ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so great; doe not despaire. Christ here saves a Theife, a Robber, happly too a Murtherer. And as in sicknesse; so in sinne. As the more dangerous the disease, the more famous the Physitian, that hath cured it: so the greatnesse of the sinne makes Gods mercie the more admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. Gods goodnesse farre exceeds mans sinne. <hi>Cain</hi> lied, in saying, his sinne could not be pardoned. It had beene, had he but askt mercie. This mans sinnes deserv'd death, not that on the Crosse onely, but eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall to. But God cries by the Prophet, <hi>Nolo mortem peccatoris,</hi> God will not the death, no not of any sinner.</p>
            <p>You see here a great sinner; yet Christ saves him. Here a late Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter too. Sinne workes mans soule hazard of hell: he hath cause to hasten his repentance. The Rabbines advise is, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent one day before thy death. Thers no man loves sinne so, but will think that reasonable. Grant it; &amp; I must add; then repent to day. Happly thou shalt not live untill to morrow. <hi>Stulte, hoc nocte,</hi> thou maist lose thy soule this night. <hi>Qui promisit poenitenti veniam, non promisit differenti cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinum. August.</hi> God, who hath promised pardon to the Repenter, hath not promised a morrow to the Delayer. It was this mans happinesse, though he had put off repentance to his last houre, yet to have Christ say to him, <hi>To day thou shalt be with me.</hi> Doe not thou adventure that. It may be thine unhappinesse, if thou to day repent not, to heare Sathan say to thee, as he said to <hi>Saul, Cras mecum eritis, to morrow thou shalt be with me.</hi> Gods grace is not at mans whistle, at his call; be thou at Gods.</p>
            <p>He calls thee often, by the Preachers Exhortation, by thy friends monition, by the Spirits inward motion, by the sudden death of many. Open but this Bible; in every leafe thou shalt light on some lesson of repentance. It is the common crie of <hi>Christ,</hi> of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> of all the Prophets, <hi>Repent, repent.</hi> Thou grants it is; but they doe not adde, to day. They doe not, for they neede not. Instant obedience is meant in all commands, where respite is not added, <hi>I made haste,</hi> said <hi>David, and delayed not, to keepe thy Commandement.</hi> The Hebrew word is ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, he askt no <hi>Quids,</hi> nor <hi>Quandoes,</hi> obeyed present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And yet <hi>Hodie</hi> is expressed too sometimes. The Wise man bids, <hi>Ne tardes,</hi> delay not, put not off, to turne to God. Delay is dangerous in sicknesse, more in sinne. Christs knocks and calls to his Spouse in the <hi>Canticles.</hi> She lingers so long, that when she opens, he is gone. No reason God should waite on man. <hi>Seeke God</hi> (saith <hi>Esay) while he will be found.</hi> If God shall crie, and man will not heare him; then man shall crie, and God will not heare him.</p>
            <p>This I preach to presumers on Gods mercie, secure sinners. Let not this mans example hearten them: theres no moe such in Scripture. Theres but one; and one will serve a submisse soule, sorrie for sinne. Such a soules repentance is not late; <hi>Haud serum est, quod verum est,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:173124:74"/> quod verum est, Cypr.</hi> It is not late if it be hearty. Not at all, is indeed desperate: So it was with this mans fellow. But it is lightly true, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, better late than never. Were I to deale with man, with moodie man, had I much trespast him, I had neede to high me, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pease him, watch my first opportunitie, runne, ride, flie to entreat him. Well if sped so. Saw he me slacke and slow, I should find him inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orable, irreconcileable. But this man deales with God. For so he belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Christ to be, though hanging on the Crosse. Else what should hee meane here by Christs Kingdome? At the losse of his life, he repents him, and is pardoned. Despaire no man of grace. <hi>Inter Pontem &amp; Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem,</hi> there is mercie. Satan at the houre of thy departure, be hee by thy bed, watch he at thy mouth, to catch thy Ghost at the last gaspe: If but then (oh that thou shouldest not before) if but then thou canst say, say with thy heart, <hi>O God, be mercifull to me a sinner;</hi> by Gods mercie that will serve. <hi>O God,</hi> there is thy faith. <hi>Be mercifull,</hi> there is prayer. <hi>To me a sinner,</hi> there is confession, <hi>i.</hi> Repentance. If thou canst but say it? That happly thou canst not, thy speech is gone. If thou canst but grone it, sigh it, thinke it; that will serve; such is Gods mercie.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Rabbin</hi> bade repent one day before thy death. I will aske lesse. <hi>Abraham</hi> said, fiftie, fortie five, fortie, thirtie, twentie, ten; so will I, one whole day, on halfe, halfe that; one houre, halfe that, one minute, ere thou die; even that (as <hi>Esay</hi> speakes) is <hi>the accepted time;</hi> God will heare thee; <hi>the houre of salvation,</hi> God will save thee. <hi>At what time so ever,</hi> the Church saith in our Liturgie. God scornes not even the taile to be offer'd up in sacrifice, <hi>Levit. 7. 3. Extrema cauda in hostiam;</hi> that is, <hi>Extrema vita in poenitentiam,</hi> saith <hi>Isidore.</hi> They that were hired at the eleventh houre, received as much as those, that had laboured all the day. My desire to winne the sinner, that long hath liv'd in sinne, to leave it yet at last; and to comfort the disconsolate and surcharged soule, hath made me long in this.</p>
            <p>To end it; <hi>Young man remember thy maker in thy youth;</hi> the Preacher bids thee. Thou shalt not happly live, till thou be old. Spend not the flower of thy yeares in idlenesse, in drunkennesse, in wantonnesse. Old men, redeeme the time lost, with repentance. God should have had your morning sacrifice; give him the evening at least. Doe not you delay; you have one foote in grave alreadie. Thinke every day the last. What know I whether ever I shall speake here againe? Whether I shall now goe hence alive againe? <hi>O God be mercifull to me a sinner. O Lord, remember once,</hi> thou that now art <hi>in thy Kingdome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second Question I propounded, was, with whom? It is with Christ. <hi>Thou shalt be with me,</hi> saith Christ. Hee is with Christ already, crucified with him, all the foure Gospells say. A happy man, that hee was with Christ so. The Crosse a cursed death; but a blessed meanes to him, his suffering then and there, to save his soule. The Atheist will aske, what profit is it to be with Christ. Many were with Christ in the dayes of his flesh; but <hi>cui bono?</hi> The Publicanes were; they sat, and ate with him. The Disciples were; they lodg'd, and liv'd with him. The ones being with him, mended not their reputation; the others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him cast on them an imputation; they were called <hi>Galileans.</hi>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:173124:75"/> Yea <hi>Peter</hi> being charged to have beene with him, was glad to deny him with an oath. Nay all the Disciples saw it so unsafe, to be with him, that they forsooke him All. Idle objector!</p>
            <p>Take the third question to this, put them together; then what spell they? <hi>To be with Christ in Paradise.</hi> And yet their being with him heere on earth was profit too. <hi>Cui bono? Cui non?</hi> The publicans and sinners, that heard him preach, and saw his wonders, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted. The Disciples though weake at his attache, yet prooved af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards the Preachers of the Gospell to all people, and the Heraulds of Salvation to all Soules. We are with Christ heere too on earth; he with us; for in us, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith. Wee suppe together, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 3. We dwell together, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. But this being indeed is but by Deputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by the gifts and graces of his holy Spirit. But put to, <hi>Paradise;</hi> to be there with him, is to have the immediate fruition of his presence, presence of his Person, his whole Person. Our Soules shall see his substance; We shall see him face to face, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. This man shall raigne with him in glory; was heere on the Crosse with him, shall there weare a Crowne with him. When Christ was but transfigured, and his face shone like the Sunne; Saint <hi>Peter</hi> said, <hi>Bonum est, esse hic,</hi> It was good to be there with him. But to be with him in Heaven, is to shine our selves like to the Sunne. <hi>Daniel</hi> saith but like the starres; that were glory enough. But Christ saith like the Sunne, in the Kingdome of his Father.</p>
            <p>We are with Christ on earth, if we be his, and his spirit be in us. But our bodies are but jayles. Our Soules through the infirmity of the flesh, lye in them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ettered, as it were, and manacled; that we cannot have full happinesse by our conjunction with him heere. We enjoy him but imperfectly. We are with him even heere. For the Kingdome of God is within us, himselfe saith. But this compard with that being with him there, is <hi>Peregrinari à Domino,</hi> to be absent from the Lord, absence in comparison. What is it then, to be with him? Aske mee not; I cannot tell. Who can? Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Eye hath not seene, Eare hath not heard, Heart cannot thinke,</hi> what is Heavens happinesse. Onely I can say, that the being with him, is the seeing of him, the beholding the incomparable, the incomprehensible beauty of Gods face. The sight called <hi>Beatifica;</hi> it makes the seers blessed; is blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse it selfe. The Crosse a cursed death. But this man may call it bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; blesse the day, he hung on it; Gods sweet opportunity, to bring him unto Christ: heere to beleeve, on him; then to be with him in Paradise; the next thing in my Text.</p>
            <p>The third question askes Where? The Disciples askt it once, <hi>Vbi Domine, Where Lord?</hi> Christ saith, <hi>in Paradise.</hi> For where else, but where Christs selfe should be? <hi>Father, I will</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>that those whom thou hast given me, be with me, even where I am.</hi> This one questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on would breed many, if time would let, and all Obiters were perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent. Some, because of the article in the Greeke Text, will have <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi> Paradise meant. The some not many, and the reason light. And this man must be with Christ: is Christ in <hi>Adams</hi> Paradise? Some, a great summe say, it is <hi>Sinus Abraha;</hi> but agree not, What, or Where
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:173124:75"/> that is.

Saint <hi>Paul</hi> is <hi>Instar omnium,</hi> he can speake of experience, for he was taken up into the place, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 2. Hee makes the third heaven, and Paradise all one. As there is as well an heavenly <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> as there was an earthly one: so there also is a ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestiall Paradise, as well as a terrestriall. <hi>Paradise</hi> in the literall sense, <hi>Adams</hi> Paradise was a place of delight; so pleasant, that the Prophet cals it, the Lords Garden. But in the Anagogicall it is farre more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent. The <hi>Alchoran,</hi> the Turkes Bible hath many large descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of all possible delights in <hi>Mahomets</hi> paradise, but earthly all, and sensuall. But this is a place <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, a thousand, a ten thousand blessednesses. This point would take up an entire Sermon; and craves a Saint <hi>Chrysostom</hi> to handle it. Come we to the last question, but the first word, <hi>Hodie, to day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Promises are ever <hi>de Futuro;</hi> it is Performance, if it be present. Heeres a Promise <hi>de Presenti,</hi> Thou shalt be with me <hi>Today.</hi> Though a daies expectance be but short; yet theres twelve houres in a Day. That in a businesse of hast is a long time. <hi>Stulte, hac nocte:</hi> was very quicke to the Rich man, <hi>Thou foole, this night shall they take thy Soule from thee.</hi> Christ is quicker heere. God might speake to the rich man, haply in the morning; and he might die haply late in the night following. But Christ saith heere; <hi>Today;</hi> and that, when day was now halfe done: When the day (as <hi>Plautus</hi> speakes) was <hi>Dimidiatus adumbilicum mortuus,</hi> twas now mid-day; sixe houres were spent of it, the next words to my Text. Heere was <hi>Dixit, &amp; factum est,</hi> the thing done almost as soone as said. The man was to die, to be taken downe, and buried, all before night; sooner, before the Sunne should set. For at sunne set the Sabbath began, and all must be done before the Sabbath. He needs not to cry with <hi>David, Lord, hast thee to helpe me; make no long tarrying, Oh my God.</hi> Tis but a little while, a little little while, that Christ deferres him. Christ hastes to die himselfe; cals of purpose for the vinegar, cryed <hi>Sitio, I thirst,</hi> thirst to die more then to drinke. For the vinegar was reacht to all that were crucified that they might die <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, saith <hi>Theophylact,</hi> to dispatch them speedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and he was dead at the ninth houre. The Souldiers too made hast to rid the theeves out of their paine. The sunne hastened too, to goe
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:173124:76"/> downe, set (in a sort) before his houre. The man dies, and according to Christs promise is immediatly with Christ, even <hi>hodie,</hi> this very day.</p>
            <p>This very day? How can that be? Christs selfe was not so soone in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise. His body was not; the grave possessed it, till the third day. His soule was not. He descended in his soule to hell, both the hell of the damned, that they might see, what salvation they had scorn'd; and the <hi>Limbus Patrum,</hi> Papists say, to fetch the Fathers thence unto this Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise. So much worke could not be dispatcht so soone. For he went downe not in <hi>virtute,</hi> but <hi>localitèr,</hi> not in the power of his Godhead, but in soule. This hath made some, as some late Fathers write, to put a point at <hi>Hodiè,</hi> and read it with the clause before, <hi>Dico tibi hodie, verily I say to thee to day.</hi> But all Greeke Copies point it, as I read it. Yea <hi>Beza</hi> saith, he found in one, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that to day thou shalt be with me. They can not mispoint that. Wee beleeve, Christ descended, the Creed binds us. And why not locally? Christs soule, united to his Godhead, might doe all that, and yet be that day in Paradise. God workes not lazily, like man. Sathan could show Christ all the Kingdomes of the world in the twinckling of an eye. Gods expedition exceeds his. Hee made the world in sixe dayes, could in sixe houres, in one. Say, Christs soule could not expedite so much so soone; Yea say, as Papists say, was as long in <hi>Limbo,</hi> as his body was in grave; yet might this man be that day with him in Paradise. For Christs soule and body was not the whole Christ. His Godhead was in heaven that day; though with his soule in hell, yet with his Father too. <hi>Vbique semper est, Aug.</hi> ever e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where at o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e. He might be with him, as God. And so Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> consters it. <hi>Epist.</hi> 57.</p>
            <p>Papists, that hold Purgatorie, are hinted by this <hi>hodie,</hi> to observe Christs great gratiousnesse, Gods great bountie, that grants <hi>votis majora,</hi> more than hee is askt. The man but prayes to be remembred, when Christ came into his Kingdome, which some expound to meane the day of Iudgement. How grievous and long paines must hee endure in Purgatorie, till that time? Well, if not in hell, where paines are worse, and thither Robbers goe. Christ in the riches of his grace, pardons all those paines, and promises him Paradise, even that very day. Let us, who hold not Purgatorie, yet note Christs goodnesse too; that (as Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith) <hi>uberior gratia, quàm precatio,</hi> Gods grace ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds mans prayer. He had seene (it is likely) the title over the Crosse, <hi>Iesus King of the Iewes.</hi> Gods Spirit had reveal'd to him, that his Kingdome was in heaven, into which he should enter after his Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection some short abode first made one earth. He prayes to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred then. Christ will not suspend him so long, fortie dayes and more. But he shall <hi>Hodie,</hi> that day, that houre almost, from that place, from that Crosse, passe into Paradise. <hi>Salut is compendium,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard,</hi> a quicke salvation, a short bridge, the Crosse, to transport him to heaven.</p>
            <p>Hee was <hi>Raptor in vita,</hi> hee is now, <hi>Raptor in Cruce,</hi> a Robber in his life, now a kinde of Robber at his death, saith <hi>Athanasius,</hi> Robbers sease on men suddenly, will be served instantly. <hi>The Kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:173124:76"/> (saith <hi>Christ) suffers violence.</hi> He is <hi>Raptor Paradisi,</hi> seases on his salvation, hath heaven at a snatch. Thats that Fathers conceit. But hee saith that of the Theefe, which belongs rather to Christ. Christ is <hi>Raptor latronis,</hi> seases on the Theefe. The man is well content to stay Christs leasure. Christ will not let him; but will have him instantly. We say of Saint <hi>Paul, Raptus est,</hi> he was caught up into Paradise. Heres on is. Christ will not stay him, till hee goe himselfe to it. Yet fortie dayes, and Christs selfe will ascend. <hi>Praemissus est, Ambrose,</hi> he will send him before him into Paradise.</p>
            <p>To conclude; the man was quicke in beleeving; Christ is as quicke in saving. His faith had many lets, his own torture, Christs Ignominie, his fellows upbraiding him, the peoples reproaching him, [one greater than all these, Christs lamentable crie, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken me.</hi>] Yet he beleeves on him. Where the Disciples lost their faith, he found his; and by it, it onely Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> saith, <hi>sola fide,</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained Paradise. Surely by it onely he laid hold on Christ, was <hi>Raptor Christi,</hi> seased on his Saviour. But that faith had workes, you heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Happy man! God makes <hi>Supplicij damnationem, Salutis occasionem,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Ambrose,</hi> as we see, God does to many malefactors, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of their bodies, the occasion of the salvation of their soules. The Lord, that made his Disciples, of catchers of Fishes, Fishers of men, and this man here, of a Robber of men, a catcher of Paradise, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member us all at the day of our departure, say unto me, unto you, to the soule of every repentant sinner, <hi>To day thou shalt be with me in Paradise.

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have heere often preacht the Funerals of Men; I preach to day the Funerall of God. The Day requires it, dedicate to the remembrance of Christs death. An office worthy an Angel, to preach at Christs Funerall. One did at his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity; and a quire of heavenly voices sung a solemne antheme at the end of the Sermon. My Text is the Catastrophe, the period of Christs Passion. Two Actes, a Cry with a loud voice, and a giving up the Ghost. The Subject to both, <hi>Iesus.</hi> Iesus cryes, and dies; thats my Theme.

            <p>
               <hi>Iesus;</hi> What Iesus? A question, which to aske I should be idle, if not vrged by the nature of the Acts heere ascribed to him, in seeming unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeming Christ. <hi>Damascenus</hi> a Greek Father saith, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

Death and vociferation doe not; they disparage him. To shreeke for paine, and to dye, beseeme the sonnes of Men. <hi>Jesus</hi> Gods Sonne, peere to his Father, should doe neither. Say, God may <hi>Cry: He cryed, and they would not heare,</hi> saith <hi>Zachary. God</hi> cries in mercy; but <hi>Iesus</hi> for paine. But dye, God cannot, is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>; the Sonne of God, but yet too the Sonne of Man. More of this in the Actes.</p>
            <p>One or two sorts of Heretickes crosse this. <hi>Basilides</hi> said, twas not Christ, but <hi>Simon</hi> of <hi>Cyren,</hi> that suffered in his likenesse. That Christ stood by invisible, and derided the Iewes madnesse. Was not this man (thinke you) rather mad? I should be, to confute him. Then woe were to the world: It is then indeed (as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> saith) <hi>totus in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligno positus,</hi> all in the devils power. If Christ have not suffered, we are not redeemed, and this monster (for so <hi>Nicephorus</hi> calls him) though he held there were 365. Heavens, yet in all likelihood is he in none of them, but a damned wretch in Hell. Long after him, <hi>Mahomet</hi> was of this opinion too. Others held, that not <hi>Iesus,</hi> but God the Father suffered, called thereon <hi>Patropassiani;</hi> an unlearned heresie, sprung of Scriptures misconstrued; Christs speech especially, <hi>I, and my Father are one. And, I am in the Father, and the Father in me.</hi> They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded the Persons, thought them all one. The heresie more foolish, then malitious. <hi>Noëtus</hi> first held it; his name presumes Wit; but <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noëtus,</hi> a foole in that opinion. Other Scriptures might have taught him, that it was the Sonne that suffered. This very story would. Christ twice upon the Crosse prayes unto his Father. <hi>Father, forgive them.</hi> And <hi>Father, into thy hands, &amp;c.</hi> The Father therefore suffered not. <hi>Constat de Persona;</hi> heare the Act.</p>
            <p>Well may we; tis a Cry. A Cry may be inward; <hi>David</hi> cryed in his heart. <hi>Psalme</hi> 119. And God askt <hi>Moses, Why he cryed, Quid cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas?</hi> When we read not, he said any thing. But this is a vocall cry; and it is <hi>Voce magna,</hi> Christ cries <hi>with a loud voice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First for the cry. Saith not the Prophet <hi>Esay, he</hi> should <hi>not Cry?</hi> He spake that of <hi>Christs</hi> comming, not of his suffering. He should come in humility, not with noise and pompe, as Princes doe, with shout of people, and sound of trumpet. At <hi>Christs</hi> Nativity was <hi>Altum silen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium,</hi> No man was aware of it. When the Wise men askt, <hi>Where is he, that is borne King of the Iewes?</hi> No man could answer them. But the Prophet saith againe, <hi>he</hi> should <hi>be as a Sheepe, dumbe before his Shearer,</hi> should <hi>not open his mouth.</hi> That he spake of his suffering. He did, and truely. <hi>Christ</hi> was silent in that too. He was hurried to and fro; from the Garden to <hi>Annas</hi> his house, from thence to <hi>Caiphas,</hi> from him to <hi>Pilate,</hi> from thence to <hi>Golgotha;</hi> up and downe the streets of the City to mount <hi>Calvary.</hi> His voice was not heard in all these streets; he spake not all the way, save once, to the women that wept for him. And yet he had suffered by that time much iudignity, much extremity; his head wounded with thornes, and his body tortured with scourges, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed with stripes, <hi>David</hi> saith. Why then cries he now? Wee shall heare that anon.
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:173124:78"/> Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> rests not here, saith not barely, <hi>he cried;</hi> addes, <hi>with a loud voyce. Christ</hi> cries not, as <hi>Moses</hi> did, grone inwardly; as <hi>David</hi> did, in his heart. Its but <hi>Clamavit</hi> here, <hi>he cried;</hi> but in Saint <hi>Marke, Exclamavit, he cried out:</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calls it <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>a strong crie. David</hi> makes it more, <hi>Psal.</hi> 22. 1. calls it <hi>Rugitum,</hi> a Roaring, a Lyons crie. It is there meant of <hi>Christ,</hi> of <hi>Christs</hi> crie upon the Crosse, his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer crie, <hi>my God, my God, &amp;c.</hi> But why is the crie? And why the voice so loud? Expositors yeeld reasons many, few of waight. Heare but two of the best. One, that <hi>Christ</hi> was not <hi>Merus homo,</hi> a meere man, but God to. The other, that he was <hi>Verus homo,</hi> very man as we are.</p>
            <p>For the first; The strength of his crie showed he was more then man. Mens spirits are spent in tormenting diseases, are not able to crie out, can scarse speake to be heard, hardly draw their breath, speake not happly at all. For all the Organs of the speech faile, <hi>Et vox faucibus haeret. Christs</hi> crie was <hi>in ipso mortis articulo,</hi> at the very instant of death. This latter crie was. His strength then to crie so, made the Centurion crie, <hi>Doubtlesse, this was the Sonne of God.</hi> Saint <hi>Mathew</hi> saith, the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, but Saint <hi>Marke</hi> saith, Christ crie made the Centurion say so. Christ will shew his might above the devills malice; that hee dies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he will, not forced by Sathan. Not of infirmity, not of necessitie, but as the Prophet saith, <hi>Quia voluit, because it pleased him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Death fled from Christ; he was faine to offer himselfe, put himselfe into deaths hands. When the officers came to take him, were showd him by <hi>Iudas;</hi> they had no power to touch him. When told, twas he, they sought, they fell before him; told againe, twas he. Twelve le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of Angels were ready to have rescued him: he would not: would not plead so much before <hi>Pilat,</hi> as not guilty. Heere he cries out aloud, to call death, who fled from him, to compell him to come: cals him once, he comes not; cals againe to presse him: Death is deafe, will not heare, though he doe, will not come, at one cry. <hi>Christ</hi> would have cryed seaven times, rather then not dye. Death is used ever to ride; Sinne is his horse, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 6. 8. The devill cannot bring him to any man, but on his backe. The sinners selfe lends death a horse; else he could not come to him, Christ being without sinne, death must come a foot to him; will not; but <hi>Christ</hi> importunes him, by force fetcheth with his cries. When he comes, he smites him, so forced; and in his mood, commits him to the grave, as to a jayle, a strong pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, twas a rocke; and covered with a great and waighty stone, and watcht with armed men. Now he hath him, would faine hold him; cannot, but fals into paines, womens paines, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 24. can not have ease, till the grave have delivered him. Saint <hi>Peters</hi> phrase there is remarkeable; the rising of the Corpse of <hi>Christ,</hi> must be the <hi>loosing of the paines of death.</hi> Nay, Christ with his cry would catch the devill too, who doubting he was God, began to flye, thought it but lost labour to plot his death. <hi>Athanasius</hi> saith, Christ cryed, cryed in this manner, to make him thinke him but meere man.</p>
            <p>Be this granted one cause of the greatnesse of Christs crie, to show him more than man: yet may this be one too, to show, he was true man; though not meere man, yet man. Torment will force a man to crie,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:173124:78"/> great torment the strongest man, to crie aloud. Man is not Iron or Oake, like <hi>Bhemoth</hi> in <hi>Iob,</hi> his bones like brasse. <hi>Hercules</hi> himselfe will shrinke, will shreeke at paine. The Racke will force false confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of crime, <hi>Etiam innocentes cogit mentiri dolor, Sen.

               </gap>, <hi>Naz.</hi> he is no man, whom paine will not make crie, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting paine. Such was Christs.</p>
            <p>There is a counter-crie among some Christians, verie unchristian, and yet Saint <hi>Hilarie</hi> a learned and good Bishop hath abetted it, that our Saviours Passion was without paine. He was scourged, woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, peirced with nailes. Hee can not deny that; both <hi>Esay</hi> saith it, and all the Evangelists. But all this did inferre but <hi>Passionis impetum,</hi> not <hi>Dolorem;</hi> all this he suffered, but <hi>sine sensu,</hi> hee felt no paine. No more than flame, or aire, or water doth, smitten with a weapon. Hee had <hi>Corpus doloris,</hi> but not <hi>Naturam dolendi,</hi> a bodie subject to offence, but without any sense of it. Nay (which is very harsh) did not so much as thirst, though he cried <hi>Sitio;</hi> said onely, he thirsted, to fulfill the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets saying. <hi>Celsus</hi> in <hi>Origen</hi> holds it too; but a heathen Philosopher. Him I heede not. Saint <hi>Hilarie</hi> I reverence, but I abhorre the rest, as Heretickes, who (as <hi>Irenaeus</hi> writes) held that <hi>Christ</hi> suffered but only <hi>Putativè,</hi> in mens imagination. Then Sinne, Death, and Sathan are yet unvanquisht, and we subject still to hell, if our Saviour suffered but onely <hi>Apparenter,</hi> but <hi>Athanasius</hi> bids us beleeve <hi>Christs</hi> whole Passion, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, really and verily.</p>
            <p>But must <hi>Christ</hi> crie, for sense of paine? Where shall we seeke for pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, if not in Gods owne Sonne? [An ordinary man will endure much. But a strong spirit, <hi>Vre, seca,</hi> will not crie out; will crie, <hi>Nihil agis dolor.</hi> The boyes of <hi>Sparta,</hi> though whipt almost to death, would not once grone.] Shall we thinke, Christ was weaker than the Martyrs? Many of them have sung in the middes of their tortures. The seven sonnes of <hi>Eleazar</hi> flea'd alive and fried, the three yong men in the fierie furnace, not any of them used any vociferation. I answer; first, to such as suffer in Gods cause, God gives strength, and approportions it unto their paines, extraordinarie strength to extraordinarie torments. God here suffers his Sonne to feele the full extremitie of the <hi>Iewes</hi> mercilesse crueltie, without the least support from him, withholds all comfort, all allay of anguish. Secondly, <hi>Christ</hi> cried not, opened not his mouth for all the tortures of the <hi>Iews.</hi> Scourged twice by the Iudge in most merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse manner, in hope, that might have moved the people to compassion.

            <p>I will not wrong thee, my sweet Saviour, so, to preferre any Martyrs
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:173124:79"/> patience before thine. It was a sharper, a farre sharper paine, then all these tenne times doubled, that made <hi>Christ</hi> crie, crie out so loud. Mans sinne lay on his soule; and Gods wrath lay on that sinne. Men in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner had now done with him. God takes him in hand, scourges him with his wrath, a rod of Iron. That <hi>Iron</hi> indeed (as the <hi>Psalme</hi> saith of <hi>Ioseph) entred into his soule;</hi> wounded not his head, hands and feet onely, made him crie, in the Prophet, <hi>Behold all that passe by, see if any sorrowes were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver like to mine;</hi> adds, the <hi>Lord hath afflicted me;</hi> not men, but God; God in his wrath, his fierce wrath. It begunne in the Garden, made him sweat bloud: but was worse upon the Crosse, forced him to crie there, <hi>Eli, Eli, lamma sabactani, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calls it a <hi>strong crie.</hi> There is reason; is not the paine so? Strong cries (for there are two of them) for strong paines. The paines much stronger than the cries. For the crie hath a parallel: <hi>David</hi> cried so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. But the paines have none. So saith the Prophet, Never any like paines, incomparable, unutterable, unconceiveable.</p>
            <p>To end this, Christs crie, S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls it <hi>strong,</hi> and the Evangelists call it <hi>loud.</hi> Iudge you, if it were not. Needs it must be strong, that rent the stones, the rockes, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: and needs it must be loud, that raised the dead. The rockes felt the strength of it, and cleft; the dead heard the sound of it, and rose. Yea the earth trembled, and the graves opened at the hearing of it, and it split the veile of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in two parts. The crie shewed <hi>Christ</hi> a man; for his paines forced it: but it showed him also God, by the working of such won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. <hi>Magna vox, magna operata est, Origen,</hi> a mightie voice, that wrought so mightie things. His voice single, without <hi>magna,</hi> had wrought great things before, had stil'd the windes, and calm'd the seas, and driven the feends out of the possessed. His submisse voyce had done thus, and many other miracles. That (<hi>Magna</hi>) put to it, his loud voice, his strong crie should doe these wonders, its no wonder.</p>
            <p>One word more is here added, of the Iteration of Christs crie, Hee cried againe. Once hee had cried before, with loud voyce too; the mournfullest crie, that ever came from man, <hi>My God, my God, &amp;c.</hi> Here he cries againe. The crie, whether a shreeke onely, or a speech too; Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> saith not; nor will I now examine. I have beene long enough alreadie in this Act.</p>
            <p>The second is Christs giving up the Gost, <hi>and gave up the Ghost;</hi> an Act in phrase, but a passion indeed; for it meanes death, and <hi>Mori,</hi> is <hi>Pati,</hi> term'd therefore by <hi>Bernard, Passio activa,</hi> or <hi>Actio passiva.</hi> The phrase hath two termes; the one shewes his voluntarie death; the other proves him perfect man. See them first severally, <hi>Emisit, non Amisit,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Ambrose;</hi> Christ <hi>gave up his Ghost,</hi> it was not forc't from him. It is said of every dying man, he gives up the Ghost, but <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

            <p>What gave <hi>Christ</hi> up? <hi>the Ghost, i.</hi> the Spirit, the Soule. <hi>Christ</hi> to have a Soule, some have doubted, flat denied. <hi>Corpus aptasti, thou hast given me a Body,</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith of <hi>Christ</hi> out of the <hi>Psalmes, Psa.</hi> 40. 7.

            <p>Yet have some brainsicke heads held this leude heresie. <hi>Eunomius</hi> did, and his followers. They thought Christ needed not an humane spirit; because he was a Spirit as hee was God. For <hi>God is a Spirit,</hi> Christs owne saying. Nay some more leud, granted him a soule, but a Beasts soule, void of reason; <hi>Apollinaris</hi> did. A dangerous heresie, <hi>Christ</hi> to have no soule, and of desperate consequent.

Then let every man at the houre of death commend his soule to sathan, not to God. For what <hi>Christ</hi> saves not, God receives not. Then may sathan say at the day of Iudgement as the King of <hi>Sodom</hi> said to <hi>Abraham,</hi> so he to <hi>Christ, Da mihi Animas, give me the Soules.</hi> And <hi>David</hi> belike meant so, <hi>Psalme 65. 2.

Yea and then poore Saint <hi>Steven</hi> was grossely mistaken, to cry, <hi>Lord Iesus, receive my Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to Christs Soule Gods word beares witnesse more then once, <hi>Christs</hi> selfe does both to day on the Crosse, <hi>Father into thy hands I commend my Spirit,</hi> and yesternight in the garden, <hi>My Soule</hi> (saith he) <hi>is heavy to the death.</hi> Dares <hi>Apollinaris</hi> say, Christ dallies with his Father, deludes God, commends a thing to him, which hee had not? Though he was no spirit, as he told his Disciples, yet he had a spirit, an humane soule. In which he groneth for <hi>Lazarus</hi> death, was troubled in it for <hi>Iudas</hi> trechery, sighed in it deepely, for the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees infidelity, and rejoyced in it at the returne of his disciples, and it is the Ghost, which he gives up in my Text.</p>
            <p>Now take both termes together, He <hi>gave up the Ghost, i.</hi> he dyed. The act now is turned passion. Theres cause, we all turnd Passion too. Wonder we all at least. Saint <hi>Chrysostom</hi> noted five wonders in Christs death, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the Greeke Fathers say, the Godhead cannot suffer. A truth which some opposing (the <hi>Theopaschita</hi> did) were censured for heretickes. It is true, the Godhead cannot; but God can. My Text saith, <hi>Iesus</hi> dyed; but his deity dyed not. He was <hi>Mista persona, Immanuel,</hi> God and Man. His Manhood dyed in him, his Godhead lived. <hi>Iesus</hi> heere though God, dyed. Thats not impossible, nor absurd: unheard indeed. Never dyed God before. For never was God Man before. This once onely he was, and that onely for us. <hi>Messiah shall be slaine, &amp; non sibi,</hi> saith <hi>Daniel, not for himselfe. For us men, and for our Salvation,</hi> saith the Creed at the <hi>Communion.</hi> Borne in a stable, cradled in a cratch, revild, bound, scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, scourged, crowned with thornes, naild to a Crosse betweene two theeves. All this sufficed him not to suffer; wrestled too with Gods
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:173124:80"/> wrath, so fierce, as forc't him to sweate blood, so much as trickled to the ground, forced him yet further in sense of paines, unsufferable paines, to <hi>Cry,</hi> and <hi>Die. Iesus,</hi> the worlds Creator, mans redeemer, almighty God, to cry and dye. This ends Christs Passion, and beginnes mine, and therefore bids me end.

And the Earthquake so great, that Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> writes, sundry Cities were overthrowne by it. The rockes rent at Christs cry, and the graves opened, and the dead corpses arose, to make roome for his body. Every grave strove to be graced by his buriall. And have we hearts of Adamant, eies of Oake, that have not a teare, not a sigh at Christs death? Had these senselesse Creatures compassion of his paines, we men not mooved at them? <hi>Solus homo non compatitur, pro quo solo Deus patitur?</hi> You my Christian Brethren, not weepe for him, who bled for you. I, more stony then you, preach and presse his paines, and feele no Passion? I rehearse, you here Christs lamentable end, for your sinnes, and mine, in your stead, and mine, and shrinke not at his shreekes, endure his death without least signe of sorrow?

Oh let us then sympathize with our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, send forth strong cryes, if not for his bitter death and passion, yet at least for our sinnes which were the cause of it, and let us not onely bewaile but crucifie those sinnes which Crucified our Saviour, that so when we cry unto God in the needfull time of trouble, he may heare, and have mercy, and in the end of our dayes when wee give up the Ghost, and with our blessed Saviour commend our spirits into Gods hands; they may be received into everlasting happines. <hi>Which the Lord of his infinite mercy grant even for the merits of his deare Son Jesus Christ.

               <hi>without him was made nothing, that was made;</hi> and I hope hee will not say, hee made himselfe. And therefore <hi>Peter Lombard</hi> determines a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Arius,</hi> that Christ was Gods Sonne, not <hi>Factura,</hi> but <hi>Natura,</hi> not by being made, but by being borne.

            <p>Now to apply this Title to the Act. The Act is Christs committing of his humane spirit to the trust of a depositarie, who should safely keepe it, and truely redeliver it. Who fitter for that office, than his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Whom shall I rather trust with any thing of price, then my natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall parent? Will you say, my brother, my neighbour, or my friend? The Prophet biddes trust them not. Every brother will supplant, and every friend will deale deceitfully. The daughter will robbe the father; <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel</hi> did, stole his gods. The son, the mother; <hi>Micha</hi> did, stole her silver. The wife will beguile the husband; <hi>Rebecca</hi> did. <hi>Laban</hi> cozend <hi>Iacob;</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> made a younger brother of <hi>Esau.</hi> But when hath ever parent cheated the child? The whole booke of Scriptures afford not one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. God hath put in parents the Image of God: Father and Mother are as gods unto their children; carefull of them, faithfull to them. <hi>It is</hi> (saith <hi>Paul) impossible that God should lie.</hi> Not impossible, but improbable a Father should deceive his son. Were a soule commendable to mans cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stodie, that hee could keepe it: I would not doubt my parents fidelitie. The dearest thing wee have next to the soule, is life. What sonne will not trust his life unto his father? What sire hath ever betraied his sonne? betraied to death? What fitter then; what kinder compellation, than Christ, to whom hee would commend his soule, to call him Father? Into his hands hee commends it; the next thing in my text, <hi>In manus tuas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mans soule hath many suiters, who faine would have it in their hands: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> God craves it, cries <hi>Da mihi, My sonne give mee thy heart.</hi> But the world, and the flesh, and the devill crave it too. All these have their hands; Sathan especially. God committed <hi>Iob</hi> to them, permitted ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Ecce in manu tua,</hi> both body and goods. His fingers itcht for his soule also, It God excepted, <hi>Serva animam,</hi> would not give him that. God would not, but man will; many a leud man, even <hi>conceptis verbis,</hi> wickedly in his life, desperately at his death, gives his soule unto the devill. The witch doth, and the Conjurer. To the world, or to the flesh most men doe in their life. For where wee love, there we lay our soules. The soule is <hi>ubi amat,</hi> more than <hi>ubi animat,</hi> where it loves, not where it lives. They two expectorate the sensuall man. Hee can not keepe his heart at home, for them. <hi>How canst thou say,</hi> saith <hi>Delilah</hi> to
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:173124:82"/>
               <hi>Sampson, thou lovest me, when thy heart is not with me?</hi> saith <hi>Solomon,</hi> the Harlot hunts <hi>Pretiosam Animam,</hi> a mans precious Soule? Shee needes not: the soule of the wanton will hunt her. <hi>Paul</hi> saith but, that the Lecher is one body with the Harlot. He might have said they are one spirit, Not as God saith of the marryed, <hi>that two shall be one Flesh;</hi> but they two shall be one soule.</p>
            <p>Wine is as strong a witch as Women; strong drinke as bad a char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of the soule, as Harlots. A man seekes it, tarries by it, <hi>Solomons</hi> termes, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 30. seekes it earely, rises betimes to it, tarries till night at it, <hi>Esaies</hi> termes, 5. 11. rests not so; but cries <hi>Cras sicut Hodie, Esay 56. To morrow shall be as to day,</hi> nay <hi>multo amplius,</hi> worse, much worse then to day: uses meates to stirre up thirst. Doth not this man commit his soule unto this Saint?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mammon</hi> is an other, to whom too many men commend their Soules. <hi>David</hi> doubted the danger of it in the <hi>Psalmes. If Riches en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease,</hi> saith he, <hi>set not your hearts on them.</hi> Whats that, but commend not your soules to them. He did it in the Gospell, that said, <hi>Soule, thou hast much goods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Trust not thy soule to these, not in thy life; Dying much lesse. Tis a <hi>Depositum</hi> then, a thing committed of trust for a time, to be received againe. But these <hi>Depositarii,</hi> the world, the flesh, and sathan, are bad keepers of soules. What is trusted to them, is lost, especially to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, desperately lost. As the Foxe said to the Lion in the Fable, <hi>Nullaretrorsum,</hi> theres the Print of many soules going towards hell, of none returning. Sathan pictured with clawes, not hands: they claspe fast, what is put in them. What is trusted to him, never returnes. His hand is a right <hi>Mortmain,</hi> a dead hand: what it hath once hold of, is unrecoverable. Thy soule trusted to him, never redemande; it boots not. Nay though thou wouldst Redeeme it, thou canst not. Christ saith, theres no <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, no ransome for a soule. None that man can give; Christ can; his Blood. It was <hi>Anima pretiosa, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons</hi> terme, a precious soule. But so is Christs blood, <hi>Sanguis pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiosus,</hi> Saint <hi>Peters</hi> terme, pretious blood too; more precious then thy soule: that will indeed ransome it. But doe not trust to that. Put not thy soule in sathans hands, in hope to have it home againe by Christ. <hi>Maledictus</hi> (saith Saint <hi>Augustine) qui peccat in spe.</hi> Christ would not tempt God so, would not cast himselfe downe headlong from the pinnacle, upon presumption that Gods Angels should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve him. Christ heere showes Christians into whose hands soules may be, must be trusted, <hi>in manus tuas,</hi> into Gods hands.</p>
            <p>But saith not the Apostle, tis a fearefull thing to fall into Gods hands? <hi>David</hi> tried it, would rather fall into Gods hands, then Mans▪ tryed it, but found no ease in it; ease in comparison, but smart enough. But this was Gods hand in his Anger? tis heavy so. Gods hand meanes not the same alwaies in Scripture. There is <hi>Manus Creans,</hi> his Creating hand; <hi>Thy hands have made me,</hi> saith <hi>David, and fashioned me.</hi> There is <hi>Manus Perdens,</hi> the Destroying hand: <hi>David</hi> notes it too, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse moe, needlesse to cite.

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:173124:83"/> hands; preserving the soule commended to them from all hurt, and reserving it to be safely rendred to the owner. Commit thy soule to them; tis sure in their keeping. A keeper must have strength and trust: God hath both, is both powerfull and faithfull, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

            <p>To end this; <hi>Father, into thy hands I commend my Spirit.</hi> Into God the Fathers hands? Why then doth Saint <hi>Steven</hi> commend his into Christs? <hi>Lord Iesus,</hi> saith the <hi>Martyr, receive my Spirit.</hi> Prayer is Gods right, Gods onely. Gods onely; but not the Fathers onely. Christ, and the Holy Ghost doe claime it also: for they are God too. Prayer is made mostly to God in generall: the Persons being three, it is meant to all at once. But the Christian hath his liberty, to pray to one apart, to any one of them alone. It is no wrong unto the rest. For all three are so one, that when one is honoured, they are glorified All. Thou speakest to one apart; but thou honorest All together. The Father is in the Sonne, the Sonne in him, the Spirit in both, both in the Spirit. What is done to one, is done to all.</p>
            <p>Men on their death-beds dispose of all things, give what they have unto their Legataries, their blessings to their Children, their bodies to the earth, from whence they were, and their Soules to God, that gave them. So doth Christ heere; his <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a kind of Will. State he had none to bestow on his Disciples. His Purse and Girdle, which are first in mens inventaries, <hi>Iudas</hi> had kept that. We read hee restored the thirty peices to the Priests: but Christs bagge wee read not, where he bestowed that. It is likely, that little, or nothing was left in it, that he made such haste to hang himselfe. Had there beene never so much, neither durst he looke Christ in the face, whom he had betrayed: and had he brought it him; yet Christ must have said, as he did in an other case, <hi>Non est meum dare,</hi> it was not his to give, it was forfeit to <hi>Caesar.</hi> So was his body at <hi>Pilates</hi> pleasure too. His cloathes, the Officers fees; he could not give them neither. But as <hi>Peter</hi> said to the Creeple, such as he had he gave. He died not altogether i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>He yeilds it not, as we doe, not to have againe till the Resurrection, till the Heavens be no more: but he resignes it, to resume it: or leaves it rather for a little time, to receive againe after a few houres; tis no resignation. Christ saith, <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. He doth <hi>Ponere,</hi> lay it downe, that he may <hi>Sumere,</hi> take it up againe. The terme in the <hi>Psalme,</hi> whence this Text is taken, the <hi>Rabbins</hi> say, signifies <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, resting and reposing. Christ heere, and all Christians, every righteous man laies
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:173124:83"/> up his Soule with God, resteth and reposeth it in his holy hands; Christ but for a day or two; we till the day of Iudgement. Our soules and bodies death sunders them but for a season; they shall one day mee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

In our Buriall of the dead, we say, <hi>We commit the body to the ground.</hi> There we declare the meaning of this terme, to be but a reposing of the body for a time. For we professe, we doe it <hi>in sure and certaine hope of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection.</hi> Tis so too with the Soule; we commit it unto God, in sure and certaine hope, not of a Resurrection, for thats onely of the Flesh, but of a Restitution. We put it in the hands of a faithfull Creator, who will deliver it.</p>
            <p>This precious priviledge have Christians above Heathens, an assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of a second life.

               </gap>, the Soule is loosed, tis not lost. The vulgar Latine Translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not good, that termes the grave, <hi>Domum aeternitatis,</hi> the bodies everlasting home: as if the Soule were divorc't from it for ever.

Then it shall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake: and our Soules are commended to his hands, but till that time.</p>
            <p>Shall I hence draw uses to curbe the sinner, or to comfort the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, because the spirit dies not; but if a godly mans, it goes to God; if a wicked mans, to Sathan; the one to heaven to joyes, the other to hell to torments? I may not without too far straying from my Text. Yet have some Christians beene so impious, as to say, mans soule is mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall.
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:173124:84"/> Say I, some Christians; yea some Popes; if stories be true: <hi>Paul</hi> the third did. Heathens to their shame have held the contrarie. <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> that said, hee knew nothing, save that he knew nothing onely, yet saith in <hi>Plato,</hi> he knew this that the soule is immortall, <hi>in Axiocho.

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, he commends his soule to God, not <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, he casts it not away. He commits it to his trust, doth not surrender it, give it over ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly. That the spirit is quite extinct by death, shall I say, tis Heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish? tis worse. Heathens themselves hold, many of them, <hi>Superesse post mortem animas,</hi> (saith <hi>Lactantius,</hi> that mens soules cease not to exist even after death.</p>
            <p>But why is this crie? Why should Christ thus commend his spirit to God? Or how is it a <hi>Depositum,</hi> a thing committed to an others trust, which the owner of it still retaines in his owne keeping? Though Christ here die; yet the soule is still with Christ. The personall union of God and man in Christ, his death dissolv'd it not. God had conjoyn'd the manhood with the Deitie. <hi>Quae Deus junxit, homo ne separet;</hi> what God knits, man cannot loose. The <hi>Iewes</hi> might kill Christ, but they could not sever them. In Christs Humanitie, there was indeed a loose: body and soule were sundred; that was all; the <hi>Iewes</hi> could goe no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Sathans selfe could not. Christ was whole still. Somewhat par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the person; but nought departed from the person. Though soule were severed from the body; yet both remain'd fast to the Deitie. The Godhead was both with the Spirit in Paradise, and with the corpse in the Sepulcher at once. The knot of the words Incarnation is undis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soluble; farre above▪ the Gordian knot; not to be loosed by Art, not by <hi>Alexanders</hi> sword.</p>
            <p>If then Christs Spirit, even when he was dead, abode still fast united to the Godhead: what meanes he to commend it to his Father? I wish some better speaker to expresse this mysterie: my tongue and wit are both to weake for it. Shall I say, he did it to teach us? thats one answer. <hi>Omnis Christi Actio, nostra Instructio,</hi> to teach us at our deaths to commend our Spirits to God. But this answers not the question, how he could com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, that he stil retain'd? He commended his soule, as he was man; but he retained it still as he was God. He retained it not as he was man: for the manhood was dissolv'd; the bodie instantly gave up the Ghost. The Manhood being now not to hold it any longer, commends it to the Godhead. But why then unto the Father? That I desire to learne, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than teach. What I gesse, you shall heare afterward.</p>
            <p>Christ to have a spirit, some have doubted, have denied it. <hi>Iohn</hi> saith but, <hi>Verbum caro factum est, the Word was made flesh. Lucian</hi> stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at this place, but needed not.

Yet have some brain-sicke heads held this leud heresie, <hi>Eunomius</hi> did. They thought Christ needed not an humane spirit, because he was a spirit, as he was God. For <hi>God is a Spirit,</hi> Christs owne saying. Nay some more leud granted him a soule, but a beasts soule, void of Reason. <hi>Apollinaris</hi> did.</p>
            <p>A dangerous heresie. Christ to have no soule, and of desperate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent. For how are our soules saved, if Christ had none. Christ hath then sav'd but the one halfe of us, and that the viler halfe; the brute flesh. <hi>Melius nostrum,</hi> Saint <hi>Austins</hi> terme▪ our better halfe is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redeemed.

Then will this follow, this grosse absurditie, one and the same man shall be both sav'd and damn'd. After the Resurrection, my body in heaven shall be in joyes, and my soule in hell in torments. Yea more absurd yet, the body that hath neither <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> as <hi>Paul</hi> speakes, neither breath, nor mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, life, nor sense, without the soule; nay no subsistence without it, yet shall be there in joy, whereof it is not capable without the soule. Then let every man at the houre of death, commend his soule to Sathan, not to God. For what Christ saves not, God receives not. Then may Sathan say indeed at the day of judgement, as the King of <hi>Sodom</hi> said to <hi>Abraham,</hi> so hee to <hi>Christ, Da mihi animas,</hi> give me the soules. Hee may say to God in <hi>Davids</hi> phrase; <hi>Vnto thee shall all flesh come;</hi> but all spirits come to me.</p>
            <p>But to Christs soule Gods word beares witnesse more than once; Christs selfe doth. He commends his Spirit, and in his Agonie; <hi>My soule</hi> (saith hee) <hi>is heavie to the death;</hi> and as he told <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> hee spake what he knew: so both here, and in his agony, hee knew what hee spake. Nor was hee idle, to dally with his Father, to delude God, to commit into his hands a thing, which he had not. Though he was no spirit, as he told his Disciples; yet he had a spirit, an humane soule. In which he groned for <hi>Lazarus</hi> death; was troubled in it for <hi>Iudas</hi> treacherie; sighed in it deepely for the Pharisees infidelitie; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced in it, at the returne of his Disciples: and it is the Ghost, which he gave up at his departure.</p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Austin</hi> in one place expounds this spirit of Christs to be his Divinitie. Vnsound Divinitie, and some bastard booke father'd on that Father. But (the best is) the same Author within a few lines following, saith the quite contrarie; that it is his humane soule. Tis fit, he say it. For that first Assertion was flat <hi>Arianisme:</hi> and is so censured else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where by <hi>Austins</hi> selfe, by true <hi>Austin.</hi> Surely the Deitie can be no <hi>Depositum.</hi> Christ would not commend it to any trust. The Godhead needs no custodie, it keepes it selfe. No nor needs Christ neither to commend his humane spirit to God, to God the Father. Christs selfe being God too, could keepe his soule himselfe. But as the voyce in the twelfth of Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> Gospell, Christ saith it was not for him, but for the people: so it is here. He would have the people see, how hee ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:173124:85"/> his Father. And that is mine answer which I respited even now. A soule commended to God at the Sonnes hands, or to the Fathers, is all one. <hi>Steven</hi> said, <hi>Lord Iesus receive my soule.</hi> All the Persons in the Trinitie are Peeres in all things touching man; in creating us, in preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving us, in keeping the soules of the living, or the dead, in all <hi>Opera ad extra,</hi> in all things of the creature. To us it is indifferent to commend our spirits to any of the three. But the case here being Christs, it beseemes the Sonne to honour his Father. What if I should adde, that the Father is Christs God; and therefore fit, he commend his Spirit to him? Saint <hi>Paul</hi> warrants me, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 1. 17. Hee calls him <hi>the God of our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> And Christs selfe warrants him, <hi>My God, my God, why h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>st thou forsaken me?</hi> He commends his <hi>Spirit</hi> into his Fathers hands; for he is his God; his God, as he is man. As God is Christs Father, as he is the Sonne of God: so he is his God, as he is the sonne of man. And tis the manhood, in which Christ cries here, <hi>Father into thy hands.</hi> Hee calls him <hi>Father,</hi> as he is God; but commends his Spirit to him, as hee is man. To conclude, <hi>Christ is Gods,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and his Father is his head: it beseemed him, it behoved him to commend his soule into his hands. <hi>Vnto this our gratious Saviour, both God and Man, and to his Father, and the holy Spirit, be, &amp;c.</hi>

Not God the Holy Ghost; but the Sonne, the second Person. Why He rather then They, is a question for the Schooles, rather then the Pulpit. I say, tis <hi>Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus:</hi> He on this day dyed on the Crosse. He is both Agent and Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in this Act. <hi>He humbled himselfe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Men humble others; loade them, till they fall; and being downe, plough on their backes. Tis honour to the poore, to sit on the foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoole of the Rich. On it? nay under it, <hi>Iam.</hi> 2. 3. Nay theres a Man

All mightie men thus humble others; Christ the Almightie God humbles himselfe.</p>
            <p>And for the Agent in this Act; as Christ humbled not others; so did not others him; but he himselfe. To the former point I used no proofe: It needed none; this doth. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith else where, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>I lie not.</hi> Can he here? Surely, it seemes, some others humbled Christ, seemes by the Gospell; that his humiliation was not of his owne accord, but forc't. Against our Apostle are all the Evangelists, foure against one. They all afford us instances. <hi>Herod</hi> is one; he humbled him, made him flie into <hi>Egypt.</hi> Thats none. Christ was then but in Cradell; twas not his flight, but his Parents. Or be that one: Who else? An other <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> humbled him, mockt him cloth'd; him in white. The high Priests bound him; their Officers smote him, blindfolded him, spat in his face. <hi>Pilat</hi> arraign'd him, scourged him, crowned him with thornes, clad him in purple, nail'd him to the Crosse. The people wag'd their heads at him, and mocked him. Tetrarke and President; Scribes, Priests, and Elders; Sergeants, Souldiers and People, all holpe to humble him. And saith the Apostle here, <hi>Hee humbled himselfe?</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> may yet say, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; he lies not for all this. All these did all these things, but as Christs instruments. All Agents in this Act of Christs humiliation; but Agents adjuvant, subalternall all. Christs selfe the maine and prime; all their activitie from and under him. Christs answer to <hi>Pilat</hi> will serve to all; that he had no power, but what was given him, given him from above. From above, not in secular sense, from <hi>Rome,</hi> from <hi>Caesar;</hi> but in Theologicall, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, from heaven, from God. And if from God; then from Christs selfe: for Christ was God. And if God; then must it follow, Man could not humble him: it must be selfe-humiliation. Be humbled for man God might; but by man he could not. The Kingdome of heaven might suffer violence: Christ said it did. But the King of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven can not. I say, Christ the Sonne of God, can not be humbled by the sonnes of men. <hi>Pilat</hi> and <hi>Herod, Gentiles</hi> and <hi>Iewes</hi> conspir'd (S. <hi>Luke</hi> saith) against Christ: but to doe what? <hi>That onely which Gods hand and Counsell had determined.</hi> Twas Gods <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

            <p>Though Christ himself, for to be humbled, assum'd our nature, for that end: yet was he God still. His Godhead freed his Humanitie from force. Whatsoever he suffered, was voluntarie all. Tis said expresly of his death, <hi>Mortuus est, quia voluit,</hi> He died because he would. Tis so of all his sufferings; All his humiliations were <hi>Quia voluit,</hi> because he would. The Officers; that came with <hi>Iudas,</hi> to take him, fell they not before him? they were many, and well weaponed: yet had they not the power so much, as to touch him; till he cried, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, <hi>Let them alone, Luk</hi> 23. 51. He was faine to put himselfe into their hands. Had not he beene pleased to humble himselfe, whole Legions of Angells, many Legions were ready at his call, to rescue him.</p>
            <pb n="159" facs="tcp:173124:86"/>
            <p>But read wee not in Scripture, and that from Christs owne mouth, <hi>An non oportuit, ought not Christ to suffer?</hi> Ought, argues a necessitie. It doth; but not <hi>Coactionis,</hi> a necessitie of force. Prophecies had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told all his Humiliations: they must be fulfilled; and Gods eternall Counsell had decreed them: neither must that faile, But both the Prophet hath <hi>Quia voluit, Esay</hi> 53. 7. And in that Counsell, would and should are one. For the three Persons are peeres in Power; one could not force an other: both in Power and Will; <hi>Vnum sunt,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> all three are one. The sacred Trinitie graciously agreed, to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble God, so to save man. The Sonne offered himselfe voluntarily, <hi>Ecce me, mitte me.</hi> His humiliation was <hi>Necessaria</hi> but yet <hi>Voluntaria,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Ambrose. Sponte,</hi> saith <hi>Origen,</hi> of his owne accord, not of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint. <hi>Christ</hi> presented himselfe an Offring to his Father: but it was a Free-will Offering. And Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> observes the Evangelists phrase, <hi>Ioh. 19. 30. Tradidit spiritum, he gave up the Ghost.</hi> Yea <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe saith plainely, <hi>Nemo tollit eam, sed ego pono eam, Ioh. 10. 18. No man takes it from me, but I lay it downe my selfe.</hi> I doe some wrong to such judicious hearers to presse so plaine a point so much.</p>

               </gap>me downe to earth, not lookt downe onely. Nay to come downe, was little; He had done that often, to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to <hi>Iacob,</hi> to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</hi> But <hi>Christ</hi> was made earth, <hi>i.</hi> man; man is earth. God said to <hi>Adam, Terraes,</hi> thou art earth. Here is a right humiliation, <hi>Homo ab humo.</hi> So <hi>Christ</hi> humbled himself; disdained not, <hi>abhor'd not</hi> (tis S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> word) <hi>the Virgins wombe;</hi> tooke mans base nature; and in basest sort, borne in a stable, cradled in a cratch. His mother not a Queene; that yet had beene some glorie. Papists salute her so, but superstitiously, <hi>Regina Coeli,</hi> Queene of heaven. Not a Lady, so they stile her too. They wrest that from her name. <hi>Maria</hi> sounds so in the Syriacke. A simple Ladie, that was faine to offer at her Churching in stead of a Lambe, a poore paire of Pigeons.</p>
            <p>God to be man was great humiliation. But he would be humbler yet, abject himselfe to the lownesse of a servant. Thats in the verse before my Text. There are honourable men, Princes and Counsellours; so high, that <hi>David</hi> calls them gods; Gods selfe doth, <hi>Ego dixi, I said ye are Gods.</hi> Such a one <hi>Christ</hi> might have beene. But he would be (Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith here) <hi>of no reputation,</hi> the meanest of men. <hi>Herod</hi> despised

               </gap>, he <hi>became obedient.</hi> It became him to be so, that would humble himselfe. Obedience becomes humilitie. The Iayler in the <hi>Acts</hi> fell downe at <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> feet. There hee humbled himselfe. Straightwayes (saith the storie) <hi>He was baptized, and all his house.</hi> Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> selfe God humbled; not himselfe; a rebell against <hi>Christ. Christ</hi> feld him to the ground; theres an humiliation, in Grammatticall sense, not in metaphor. As the Iaylor cried to him, so cried he to <hi>Christ, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, quid vis faciam? Lord what wilt thou, that I doe?</hi> So the people at the preaching of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> humbled first by their Doctrine, crie all, <hi>Quid faciemus?

            <p>As it is with men, so it was with <hi>Christ.</hi> Thrice he humbled himselfe, prayed prostrate on mount <hi>Olivet</hi> before his Passion. Indeed his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane will desired to live, prayed against that Cuppe and Houre. But he checkt that will instantly; and in all obedience submitted it to Gods: <hi>Fiat voluntas tua.</hi> Twas fit he should▪ for was hee not Gods Sonne? He called God Father in that prayer. Sonnes obey earthly parents; <hi>Christ</hi> would much more his. Yea Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith to the <hi>Hebrewes, Chap. 5. ver.</hi> 8. that <hi>Christ</hi> by his sufferings learned to obey; <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, his humiliation taught him to obey. To end this, Divines ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve in <hi>Christ</hi> a twofold obedience; Active, his perfect performing of the Law; and Passive, his patient endurance of the curse. The former I omit, (tis <hi>parergon</hi>) fits not either Text or time. The latter is my Theme; tis it Saint <hi>Paul</hi> meanes; and this Day requires it; <hi>Christs</hi> Passive obedience. There are many kindes of it: you have heard of some already; <hi>Christs</hi> usage, his course usage before <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilat,</hi> and by the Priests and people. The chiefe remaine, and follow here; the utmost extremitie, <hi>Death;</hi> and the basest indignitie, <hi>the Crosse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now craves this Argument a <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> a <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> an eloquent <hi>Apollos,</hi> mightie in the Scriptures, and fervent in the Spirit, to presse <hi>Christs Passion,</hi> to expresse his paines, to preach <hi>Christs Funerall Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi> Weepe not you that can chuse, wonder not you that conceive not your Saviours sufferings on this Day, for your sinnes, and in your stead.

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> they are his words. Twas wonder-worthy, God would be pleased to hee reconciled to man, who had displeased, despised so mightie a Creatour: Base clay-clod man, a despicable worme, the King of heavens inexplicable Deitie. Great persons are irreconcileable.
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:173124:87"/> The wonder greater, <hi>Quod per filium,</hi> would, to save man, humble his owne Sonne; for a servant, for a slave, <hi>Sathanae mancipium.</hi> A slave? An enemy. Will a man part from his Sonne, to gratifie his Friend? The basest begger will not, will beare it rather at his backe. Wonder more yet, <hi>quod per sanguinem.</hi> Christ must not onely become man, but miserable man. Many men are high and honourable. Termed I a man a slave?

            <p>Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> hath two wonders yet, greater than all these, these in my Text, Christs <hi>Death,</hi> and <hi>Crosse.</hi> Of the <hi>Crosse</hi> anone; first of his <hi>Death.</hi> Sufficed not bloud, foure blouds?

I will crie with <hi>Ieremy,</hi> wonder yee Heavens for this. And so they did, heaven and earth both, both in their kind. The earth shooke, and the stones rent at Christs yeelding up the Ghost.

            <p>Nor will I now bid you weepe any more: But I will say, weepe yee heavens for this. And so they did, Heaven and Earth both, both in their kinde. The eclipsed Sunne hooded his face, put on <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, saith <hi>Amphilochius,</hi> clad his whole body with darkenesse, as with a sable robe, to be a mourner at Christs Death. The earth trembled with griefe, and rent her heart, <hi>i.</hi> the stones with sorrow. Nay she would not be comforted, but opened her graves, as it were her bowells. Oh the senselesse and gracelesse stupiditie of men, of me, of many, of most men, that have no compassion on Christs Passion! when, our sinnes be the cause, the sole cause of his sufferings, yet shed not a teare on the day of his Death! [Christ cried alloud, and strongly. His cries Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calls <hi>Strong,</hi> Saint <hi>Mathew Loud,</hi> and needs they must be so: both strong, that rent the stones, and loud, that raised the Dead.] Nay that in singularitie feast upon this Day, for feare of superstition; or else in sensualitie, hawke, hunt, and dice, and dance away this Day.</p>
            <p>His death, yet (if you please) worthy more wonderment. Let us wonder againe, we never can enough at this admirable Act of Christs Humiliation. You heard before of <hi>Chrysostomes</hi> five wonders. Christs
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:173124:88"/> Death was but one of them. Let mee adde to them three more, all in Christs Death. I say, for Christ to die, there are three wonders more. First, that he would, we being his enemies. Sinne had made us so. Will one friend die for an other? [One happily will. <hi>Nisus</hi> would for <hi>Eury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alus, Me, me, adsum qui feci.</hi> And yet Poets will faigne, write <hi>Mira<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>da,</hi> not <hi>Cred enda.</hi> A father will for a sonne, <hi>David</hi> for <hi>Absalon, Would God I had died for thee.</hi> Never any for an enemy.] The second, that hee should. Death is sinnes wages; Christ had none, knew none. <hi>Adam</hi> had not died, had he not sinned, had liv'd till this day. Lastly, that hee could, being the Sonne of God. That the everliving God should die, like man; that the Lord of Life should suffer Death; that the ancient of dayes, as <hi>Daniel</hi> titles God, and he whose yeares can not faile, as <hi>David</hi> speakes of him, should yet give up the Ghost.</p>
            <p>Is this the Immortall King, Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> terme? That dwells in Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitie? <hi>Esayes</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> Father of Eternitie? <hi>Everlasting God,</hi> that lasted a few yeares, and died; liv'd not halfe a mans age. A mans age <hi>David</hi> defines it threescore yeares and ten. Many live many moe. Christ not halfe so many, not thirty five. Theres one saith, fiftie, <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi> doth; An errour. Say Christ did; yet thats scarce halfe of some mens yeares, some of our mens. Men have liv'd since the Floud foure or five hundred yeares; before it twice as long. <hi>Iacob</hi> more than one hundred, many more: and yet he said, his yeares were few. Christ saw not the fourth part of them. <hi>Daniels</hi> ancient of dayes, dies a young man. Such speed made God to die for man; hastned to death, to work us life; would shorten his life, to sweeten his grace, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. He spurr'd <hi>Iudas</hi> to dispatch, <hi>Quod facis, fac cito,</hi> that thou dost, doe quickly. Hee needes no spurre, whom <hi>Sathan</hi> drives; yet hee prickes him on; thought the Priests Officers very slacke too, quickned them also; told them, twas he, they sought. They went backward and fell; told them againe twas hee; put himselfe into their hands. Sathan hastned his end; Himselfe hastned it more. So hungred Christ after our health, thought it long, till he delivered us. Himselfe saith it, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 50. that he was pained till it was done.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Ad quid tanta profusio?</hi> Why would our Saviour humble him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe thus? His least humiliation was <hi>Meriti infiniti,</hi> the lightest of Gods sufferings sufficed to ransome man. <hi>Etiam non moriendo,</hi> even though hee had not died. Tis a Popes saying, Saint <hi>Gregories,</hi> but the first Pope of that name and the best; and the saying sound▪ well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strued. God could have saved us many wayes. Tis not my speech, but Saint <hi>Austins.</hi> Late learned Writers say the same; <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> doth. <hi>Potuit sed noluit,</hi> tis Saint <hi>Austins</hi> too. He could, but would not, chose this way, by Christs humiliation. Yea by Christs humbling of himselfe thus farre, even <hi>unto death.</hi> Weigh Christs least suffering by the worth; it would have served to save tenne worlds. But God in counsell decreed this, Christs Death and Crosse: and therefore Christ must suffer both. Other, the least, had merit too, <hi>Meritum infinitum.</hi> But his <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Crosse</hi> had <hi>Meritum definitum.</hi> What God in his Will, and his Spirit in his word had once set downe, that must be done: and therefore Christs selfe saith, <hi>Luke 24. Ought not Christ suffer these things?</hi> And
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:173124:88"/> thus it behooved him to suffer, tis there too. Theres <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>c, &amp; Sic,</hi> Thus, and these things, <hi>i. Death</hi> and the <hi>Crosse; &amp; Oportuit,</hi> of them both. Hee must be humbled so.</p>
            <p>Thus low the Lord humbled himselfe: lower he could not. Death cald by the <hi>Civilians, Vltimum Supplicium,</hi> the farthest paine. Theres no <hi>Plus Vltra,</hi> nothing after death. The <hi>Crosse</hi> is here: but thats for the indignity. Else tis before it; before it in the Creed, <hi>Crucifixus &amp; Mortuus;</hi> death is last. Death hath a follower, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 6. 8. tis hell; and some doe humble Christ to it, even to infernall torments. I dare not. Christ (it seemes) did not himselfe. If he did, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> is to blame, to omit it heere; a worse degree of Selfe-humiliation, then all the rest. <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Crosse</hi> are short of it. Scripture puts mans Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption on Christs Blood onely, and these two, his <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Crosse.</hi> And <hi>In Rebus Fidei,</hi> matters of Faith, Scripture phrase shall confine me.</p>
            <p>To end this, Death of all dreadfull things, the <hi>Philosopher</hi> cals, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, most terrible, cald by <hi>Iob, King of Terrours.</hi> Nature shuns it, flies it, will suffer torture, to scape it. Sathan though a Lyer, said that true, <hi>A man will give all that he hath for his Life:</hi> but not his life, for all that the World hath. God had no greater terrour, to fray <hi>Adam</hi> from the forbidden fruit, then <hi>Morieris, thou shalt Dye. I will not Dye,</hi> saith <hi>David. David</hi> would not; but Christ would, <hi>Davids</hi> Sonne. Man will not, when he must; yeelds, but of force. Christ would, and needed not; needed not, but that he would; dyed, <hi>quia voluit,</hi> you heard before, because he would. Why say I, needed not? Himselfe saith <hi>Oportuit,</hi> hee ought, and must. Must, because Man. <hi>All</hi> men must die. Christ must come under statute, if he will be Man, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>statutum est, Heb. 9. 27. Death</hi> to man is a <hi>Statute, Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus,</hi> to <hi>All men. Tanti constitit nasci Deum,</hi> if God will be Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and be borne a Man, then he <hi>must</hi> die. But still <hi>Must, Quia Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luit.</hi> Death came by Sinne, had not beene, but for <hi>it;</hi> is but where <hi>it</hi> is. Christ having none, needed not dye. Say, Death had beene, though Sinne had not, as once <hi>Pelagius</hi> said: yet was Christ free. Kings pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge their Sonnes from many Lawes, <hi>Satutum est,</hi> reacht not to <hi>him.</hi> Yet even to Death, fearefull to <hi>All</hi> flesh, the Word, made flesh, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled himselfe. His Flesh, though Gods, feared it, like ours; swet for feare of it, his sweat blood; prayed to escape it, thrice, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly. At that instant it did; but instantly yeelded, <hi>Non quod ego volo,</hi> humbled it selfe even unto Death. I must breake off this Argument, though loath. The <hi>Crosse</hi> craves audience too; a Word of <hi>it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Was Death an horrour? Whats the <hi>Crosse? its</hi> farre more horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The kind of Death is oft more fearefull, then Deaths selfe. The <hi>Crosse</hi> is▪ a shamefull, a painefull, an Accursed death. For shame, <hi>foedum Supplicium,</hi> a filthy death, <hi>Alexander ab Alexandro</hi> so termeth it.

Age could not weare him. Sickenesse is from distemper: Christ could not be sicke. He must be put to death, if he will die. Nor could he that neither, but that he would. As God; nay as man, Man in Gods image, without sinne, is not subject to death, to any death, naturall or violent. Yet Christ willing to die, why would he die thus? The Iewes offered to stone him, offered twice. Christ would not die so. They would have throwne him downe from the edge of an hill. Neither would hee die so. He would die thus. A shamefull death, painefull, and accurst; to free all sinners, from all three, shame, paine, and curse, all due to sinne.</p>

            <p>Theres one excepts one, he that made the <hi>Mariale,</hi> is bold to joyne the Mother to the Sonne, makes <hi>Marie</hi> helpe her Sonne to heale. Nay, makes the Mother to thrust out the Sonne, bids flie to her name onely; that alone will serve to heale. Then Saint <hi>Peter</hi> wrote false Greeke,

            </p>
            <p>But besides the <hi>Oportet,</hi> or neede of him to heale us, that he must, or none; there is a <hi>Complacuit</hi> too. God of his Love to us, would by his stripes worke health to us. A Love-worthy double wonderment, both in the Father, that would not spare his Sonne, and in his Sonne, that would not spare himselfe. For the first, will a Father part from the fruit of his body, to gratifie his friend? Or will a Mother give away the child of her owne wombe? The basest begger will not, but will rather beare it at her backe. But God hath, <hi>Dedit,</hi> saith our Saviour, he hath given us his onely begotten Sonne, and that (<hi>Dedit</hi>) is a (<hi>Tradidit,</hi>) the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers so construe it, hath delivered him to death for us. God spared <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> sonne, and sent a Ramme to ransome him. When <hi>Abrahams</hi> knife was even at <hi>Isaacks</hi> throate; an Angell cried to him to hold his hand. He did not so unto his own; but committed him to the moode and malice of the Iewes to be tormented, to be slaughtered. Say, there was an <hi>Oportet,</hi> Mans sinne must have a sacrifice; must the Father be the Priest? For so he was <hi>authoritativè</hi> though not <hi>executivè.</hi> Say, the Sonne must be the sufferer: must the Sire needs be the Offerer? Could there be found none other to give him up but God? The Father so farre to forget all affection, to sacrifice his Sonne? And for the Sonne, say, he would appease his Father with an offring, would he find nothing to offer, but himselfe? <hi>O altitudo!</hi> Oh the depth of the riches of the love of God! Was there no ransome for the sinne of man, but onely the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fring of the Sonne of God? The Altar was the Crosse; and must Christ be the Crucifixe? <hi>Peters</hi> advise is plausible, <hi>Propitius tibi esto,</hi> every man will favour, who will not? Spare himselfe? Christ would not. Hee might have said with <hi>Moses, Mitte per quem mittes,</hi> Father, send some other. But he said with <hi>Esay, Ecce ego, mitte me,</hi> Here am I, send none but me.</p>
            <p>Sinne (saith Saint <hi>Augustine) Aut sanabitur, aut damnabitur,</hi> must be either heal'd, or damn'd.

            <p>The Physicke followes, it is <hi>Stripes.</hi> Stripes should seeme rather to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> make sore, then sound; to wound, then heale. A strange medicine to cure a sicknesse. I find in Scripture a Shaft, and Shield of Health, a Helmet, and a horne of Health; but not a Stripe of Health. I read of sinne to be <hi>punished</hi> by Stripes, <hi>Psalme</hi> 89. chastened with rods, there too. But of disease <hi>cured</hi> by Stripe, but onely once: <hi>Iasons</hi> Impostume, which Physitians could not cure, was cured in fight by the stroke of a Sword. <hi>Tullie</hi> reports it. Heere is mans sinne healed by Gods Stripe, one stripe heald by another; sinne the Serpents sting, Sathans stripe, heald by Christs stripe. As the yong Pelicanes hurt by the Serpent, the damme cures with her blood. Christ heald many by his Words; <hi>Verbis,</hi> and that was miraculous. But to heale any by his Stripes, <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beribus,</hi> especially passive stripes, <hi>vapulabat &amp; curabat,</hi> saith <hi>Augustine</hi> that exceedes all Wonders. <hi>Mirabile &amp; Incomparabile,</hi> tis <hi>Augustines</hi> too, not strange alone, but incomparably strange, that the Physitian must be sicke, that the Patient may be whole.</p>
            <p>Christ to heale sinne, must suffer, must suffer (<hi>multa</hi>) many things, <hi>Math.</hi> 16. Hunger, thirst, temptation, scorne, contumely, bandes; all farre unfit for God to suffer: and yet these were the least and ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test. But his sacred Body to be beat with scourges, <hi>Foedum Supplicium,</hi> as a Schooleman cals it, a paine so base, as might not be inflicted on a Burgesse of <hi>Rome,</hi> to lay it on the Lord of Heaven, Oh the bowels of his love, that suffered it! Oh the prodigiousnesse of sinne, that caused it! Why heald he not our sinne by some Apothecaries drugs? <hi>Solomon</hi> disables them, neither Herbe, saith he, nor plaister; but Christs Stripe. Not the stripe of a reed, though they smote him with that too, that was not <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, that haply drew no blood. Not the stripe of a rod; they thought that paine too mild for him. But they did <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, whip him with sharpe scourges. Nor were his stripes but few; though the number heere be singular, tis an ordinary Trope, one put for a multitude. Being scourged for us, who know our masters will, but doe it not, his stripes were many. He that had not (as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith) <hi>peccati vestigium,</hi> the print of any sinne, had the print of many stripes. There was indeed in the scourgings of the Iewes, <hi>plagarum modus,</hi> a stint of stripes, <hi>Deut.</hi> 25. they might not exceed fourty. But Christ heere sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenc't by the Romane Iudge, was scourg'd (tis likely) after the Romane use. Twife it is thought; and that of purpose in most cruell manner, to move the people (if it might be) to compassion. One Officer suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:173124:92"/> to chasten many: foure set to torture one, as is gatherd by the parting of his robes into foure parts, and those foure all souldiers, men lightly neither of the lightest hands, nor softest hearts. Nay there is a Spanish Postiller, writes I know not on what ground, that the Iewes fearing <hi>Pilate</hi> would discharge him after stripes, gave money to the Officers, to scourge him to death. And for the instruments, it was but <hi>quasi flagellum,</hi> Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> terme, but (as it were) a whip, and but of small cords, with which Christ drave the buyers and sellers out of the temple.

One may touch without stroke; <hi>Thomas</hi> toucht him, handled him. One may be smitten and not bleed; they smote him with their hands, and with a reed. Nor is every bloodshed cald a wound. His head bled, prickt with the thornes, his backe lasht with the scourges, his whole body in his agony: and yet his wounds are counted but five onely, two in his hands, as many in his feet, and the fifth in his side. Call them what you please, heere is blood store. Christs blood <hi>Peter</hi> cals pretious. Surely it seemd not so to <hi>Pilate,</hi> and the <hi>Iewes,</hi> they made no spare of it, <hi>totus pro corpore san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis,</hi> Christ nothing but blood; not <hi>Grumi,</hi> drops onely, as in his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gony, but <hi>Vnda sanguinis,</hi> saith <hi>Bernard,</hi> a flood of blood. That that which <hi>Zipporah, Moses</hi> wife said unto her husband, <hi>Sponsus sanguinum es mihi,</hi> thou art a bloody spouse to me; and yet that blood was her Infants, not her owne, and that shed but once, Christ may justly say to the Church, which is his Spouse, <hi>Sponsa sanguinum es mihi,</hi> thou art a bloody Spouse to me. I pray you note the number, <hi>Sponsus sangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> Grammar hardly beares it, but the Originall is so. We are not <hi>borne ex sanguinibus, Ioh.</hi> 1. 13. but we are heald <hi>ex sanguinibus,</hi> not by one blood, but by many, that is, by blood shed often.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ad quid perditio haec?</hi> What needs all this profuse effusion of blood? The <hi>Oportet</hi> did not necessitate so much. One drop would have sufficed to have healed the whole world. Nay what needed blood at al? Not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not his death, but not his stripes, nay not the least indignity, that hee suffered all his life, was of absolute necessity. The least ache of his least finger had been <hi>Meriti insiniti,</hi> meritorious enough to have medecind all
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:173124:92"/> the world. But his Blood, his Death, his Crosse was <hi>Meriti definiti;</hi> God had determind it: and thence came the <hi>Oportet;</hi> both that hee should suffer, and he should suffer so.

Quis negat,</hi> (saith Saint <hi>Bernard,</hi>) that Almighty God might have found out other meanes for Mans Redemption. <hi>Etiam non moriendo, Greg.</hi> Christ could have releived us, and not have dyed for us. His onely In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation could have cured us. As the Centurion said to Christ, <hi>Lord, say but the word; and my Servant shall be whole:</hi> So might the Sinner say to God, Lord, send but the word; and thy Servant shall be whole. Nay in the Centurions very termes, Lord say but the word. The curse of sinne God could have canceld, <hi>etiam sine Adventu,</hi> even without<note place="margin">Ser. 19. de Sanctis, Ep. p. 499.

He would suffer stripes, hee would suffer death for us.</p>
            <p>Why God would worke by blood, what he could have wrought by<note place="margin">Ep. 190.</note> word, Aske him, saith <hi>Bernard,</hi> I know, <hi>Quod ita,</hi> but not <hi>Cur ita,</hi> That he did so, but not Why he did so. And yet one Why Christ yeilds himselfe: <hi>Sic Deus dilexit,</hi> a great cause, and a sweet, the Love of God. <hi>Christi viscera patent per vulnera, Bernard.</hi> Christs Passion came of his Compassion. That Love bred the Decree, that Christ should die. That Decree brought the <hi>Oportet,</hi> that he must die. And that death brought our health.</p>
            <p>Tis but Stripes in my Text; but thats by figure, a <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, more meant, then said; his Stripes put for his death. Not that Saint <hi>Peter;</hi> meant to extenuate Christs Passion by a <hi>terminus diminuens:</hi> for in the beginning of the verse, the Crosse is mentioned too, and his death im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied under it; by which death we are healed. Not as <hi>Iudah</hi> said of <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Benjamin,</hi> the life of the father hung on the life of the sonne:<note place="margin">Lib. 22. c. 22. de civit. dei de Trin. 10.</note> but our life hangeth on Christs death, our health, on his stripes. <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicamenta</hi> be <hi>tormenta,</hi> Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, tis true heere, our Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine is Christs Torment. I will not heare Saint <hi>Hilary,</hi> that faith, Christs<note place="margin">Strom. 6. p. 276.</note> Passion had no paine. He wrongs Christ much. It was <hi>Clements</hi> errour too, that Christ did not suffer, could not suffer paine. I will not argue it; tis but a <hi>parergon.</hi> Onely but heare the Prophet crying in Christs person, <hi>Si est dolor, sicut meus,</hi> See if any sorrow, any griefe be peere to his.</p>
            <p>To end this second terme; it seemes some hang not their health on Christs stripes; no nor on his death. They will have Christ to have suffered for our sinnes, the paine due unto our sinnes; the whole paine due unto our sinnes: which is not death onely, but hell too. But the Scripture determines Christs Passion in his death. That they will grant too. But they will have Christ to have suffered hell alive, hell in his Soule. Mens conceipts are free: but Gods word warrants but his death onely to redeeme us. His blood was a full satisfaction for our sins.

For how was <hi>Adams</hi> sinne infinite, that it should be punisht with Hell, a paine infinite? But because it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted against God, who is infinite. Even so was Christs Death infinite, because it was suffered by Gods Sonne, who is infinite. That Christ should suffer the paines of hell in soule, let Heretickes hold it, (twas first their Paradoxe) it is not worthy of <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Danaeus,</hi> or any learned Protestant. A drop of Christs bloud, being the Sonne of God, is equipollent to all the paines of hell. I have once or twice before lighted on this point. Saint <hi>Austin</hi> shall conclude it, <hi>Quis audeat dice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re▪</hi> Who dareth be so bold, saith Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> as to say that Christ<note place="margin">Epist. 99.</note> suffered death in his soule.</p>

The stripes were his; but the health is ours. The change of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is worthy much wonderment; the Medecine applied to one, the cure wrought on another. He scourged, we healed. Christ tooke the Physicke, but to Medecine us. Is he not our Head? As to cure the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die being sicke, the Head is faine to drinke a bitter potion: so we, that are Christs members, being sicke of sinne, Christ, who is our Head, is faine to take the Physicke, a loathsome and irkesome purgation, to heale us. Not a dose of Oximel, Vinegar and Honie, sowre and sweet together; but Vinegar and Gall, whatsoever; to heale us.</p>
            <p>The Project of Christs Passion was to ransome man. Charitie (they say) <hi>à semetipsa incipit,</hi> beginnes at home. Christs charitie did not; it began, proceeded, and ended, all in us. Whatsoever our Saviour ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>ferebat</hi> or <hi>gerebat,</hi> either did, or abidde, it was for us. Both <hi>Natus nobis, &amp; datus nobis, Esay</hi> 9. 6. he was delivered out of the wombe for us, and hee was delivered up to death for us. <hi>For us men Incarnatus,</hi> saith the <hi>Nicene Creede,</hi> and <hi>for us men condemnatus,</hi> bred for us, and dead for us. Tis tenne times in this Chapter, that his suffering was for us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We are healed?</hi> Who we? <hi>Wee,</hi> whose father is corruption, and the wormes our sisters, and kindswomen, <hi>Iobes</hi> termes. Wormes our sisters? Wormes our selves: both <hi>Iob</hi> and <hi>David</hi> call us so. Gods selfe in <hi>Esay</hi> calls us so. Wee, whose strength is as the leafe, the faded leafe, and our substance as the drie stubble; loathsomnesse our beginning, and rottennesse our end. Gods honorable and blessed Sonne was scourged for miserable and wretched man: the Sonne beat for the servant; <hi>Vt redimatur servus, mactatur filius, Aug.</hi> The Sunne slaine for the servant. Againe, who we? We that are ficke of sinne, spiritually sicke. Christs cure is not meant of corporall diseases, because Christs cure which he wrought on their bodies was an earnest of the health: And therefore in Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> it followes on this Text, <hi>That we all are gone astroy,</hi> all of us lost sheepe. <hi>Christ</hi> came not to save, but <hi>that which was lost.

It is a sweet saying, and worthy all embracing, that <hi>Iesus Christ came into the world, to save sinners.</hi>

            <p>An other thing remarkeable; the number is changed too, not the Person onely. <hi>He</hi> scourged, <hi>we</hi> healed. <hi>Ad unum poena, salus redundat ad plurimos,</hi> by ones mans stripes comes all mens health.

            <p>The Cure is last; tis Health. Strange that such Physicke should work <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> such effect; that stripes should heale. But <hi>Medico omnipotenti,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Augustine;</hi> When God Almightie will be the Physitian, every thing will be a medicine. Strange the touch of one corpse should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive an other, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 13. But it was a Prophets corpse. Strange, Salt should helpe either bitternesse of water, or barrennesse of land; more likely to hurt both. But a Prophet did it too. Strange, Clay and Spet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, should make a blind mansee, <hi>Sputum &amp; lutum,</hi> an ointment likelier to make one blind. But twas Christ, Gods annointed, that annointed him. He whose spettle anneald him, by his stripes hath healed us. God can bring light out of darkenesse, life out of death. Said <hi>Austine, Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camenta,</hi> were <hi>Tormenta,</hi> medicines are torments? We may turne the termes, <hi>Tormenta</hi> be <hi>Medicamenta,</hi> Christs torments are our ease.

            <p>The Preacher saith, there is a time to kill, and a time to heale. Both met here together; the killing of Christ was the healing of Christians. <hi>Virtus mea Domini infirmitas,</hi> the Lords weakenesse is our strength, saith <hi>Ambrose.

The then Bishop of <hi>Vienna</hi> caused on these three dayes, for the appeasing of Gods wrath, a generall Fast, and Letanie; and a provinciall Synod made it an annuall ordinance. This pious constitution begun first in <hi>France,</hi> 100. yeares after was seconded at <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Pelagius</hi> Bishop there, upon the like occasion of Gods evill angels, sent also among them, Inundations of waters, and great Pestilence, and time spread that observance of the three Rogation dayes through out all▪ the we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterne Churches. So intituled of the Liturgie used at that time; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in the Letanie the people cry, <hi>Te Rogamus Domine,</hi> at the end of every petition, <hi>Wee beseech thee to heare us, good Lord.</hi> This for the time; now for the Text.</p>
            <p>I reade it, as you have it in the ordinary <hi>Psalmes, He sent, &amp;c.</hi> The words are few, but have three termes, an Agent, <hi>Hee;</hi> the Act, <hi>sent
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:173124:100"/> evill angels;</hi> the Object, <hi>among them.</hi> All three darke, without glosse: <hi>Hee, i.</hi> God; <hi>sent evill angels, i.</hi> Plagues; <hi>among them, i.</hi> the <hi>Aegypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> Gods vengeance on both King and People, for detaining <hi>Israel.</hi> The 10. plagues of <hi>Aegypt</hi> are famous in the world. A plague signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a stroake. The smiter is named Vers. 21. <hi>the holy one of Israel.</hi> The smitten, Vers. 43. <hi>Aegypt</hi> and <hi>Zoan;</hi> the strokes are exprest in their particulars from Vers. 44. to 51.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hee,</hi> in the holy tongue is (as <hi>Rabbins</hi> say) one of Gods names. That little skills; tis not here in the originall. But that God here is meant the Author of this Act, the sender of these Angels, that skills much. Thrice in the Gospel it is askt of Christ, <hi>Quis est iste,</hi> who is this? His wonders caus'd that question. Here are signes and wonders, Ver. 43. wrought by some person, <hi>Hee sent;</hi> why may we not aske of him▪ <hi>quis est Ille,</hi> who is Hee? Tis God. Sobriety may aske that; for it tends to Gods glory. The Agent is the Lord. But rest wee there; goe not on to <hi>Pharaohs</hi> question; he askt▪ <hi>Who is the Lord?</hi> Hee is an Atheist that askes that. This then here is the first lesson, <hi>A Domino factum est istud,</hi> the sending of evill angels is Gods act.</p>
            <p>It is his act, for tis is his office, to doe justice. Is he not the Iudge of all the world? <hi>Abram</hi> cald him so once, <hi>David</hi> often. One act of justice is vengeance, and God claimes it, <hi>Mihi vindicta, vengeance is mine.</hi> His Prophet proclaimes it, <hi>ultio Domini est, vengeance is the Lords.</hi> Prophane Heathens knew not this, turnd God into Goddesse, Hee into Shee. Doe not some Papists so too, for, <hi>Hee shall bruise thy head, Hee, i.</hi> Christ that read, Shee shall bruise thy head, Shee, <hi>i.</hi> a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. Heathens held <hi>Nemesis</hi> the goddes of revenge, the punisher of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men. Thats shee, whom the Barbarians, when the Viper hung upon <hi>Pauls</hi> hand, cried, <hi>vengeance would not let him live,</hi> thinking he was some murtherer. Many Christians, not so grosse, to make she▪ Gods, feminine Deities, will yet ascribe all kinds of unkind accidents, befalling either particular persons, or whole states, to dismall and disastrous dayes, to the malevolent aspects of Planets, and the evill influences of other stars, mistake the hoast of heaven for the God of heaven▪ yea (which is worse) to wicked spirits, will impute these evill angels to the Devill and his angels. Haply these secondary causes are imployed; but they all are but meere instruments, the prime author is Gods selfe.</p>
            <p>Others haply of simplicitie will not dare make God the sender of these angels. For can that which is evill come from him that is good? These have not learned, that there is <hi>Malū poenae,</hi> as well as <hi>malum culpae,</hi> that all evill is not sinne; but the punishment of sinne is cald evill too. That men shall not feare to make God author of that evill, Gods selfe is his warrant, who takes it on himselfe. <hi>Is there any evill in a cittie, and the Lord hath not done it?</hi> Saith the Prophet, <hi>Amos</hi> 3. 6. God saies it tenne times in one Prophet, <hi>Ego adferam, I will bring evill on the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> Nor is God therefore not good, because he sends such evill. For is he not just too? Gods attributes <hi>non se tollunt invicem,</hi> they supplant not one another. Evils come on men, from men, from beasts, from sathan, from all creatures; but they all are but Gods instruments. All evills of punishment whether lighting on the wicked for revenge, or on the
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:173124:100"/> godly for their tryall, upon whomsoever, for what cause, or to what end soever, are from God, all.</p>
            <p>Shall I instance here in some particulars? It skils for the checke of most mens readinesse, to runne upon the meanes, to curse, and seeke revenge on them, not considering that God sends them. <hi>David</hi> did not so, when <hi>Shemei</hi> raild and threw stones at him. <hi>The Lord</hi> (saith hee) <hi>hath bidden him.</hi> The Sabees and Chaldeans had rob'd <hi>Iob,</hi> fire from heaven burnt his sheepe and servants, and a tempest slaine his children; yet <hi>Iob</hi> cryed, <hi>Dominus abstulit,</hi> the Lord had taken them. An evill spirit vexed <hi>Saul;</hi> but <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, sent from God. Fire from heaven, and brimstone burnt <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah;</hi> the Lord rained it, the text saith. The Philistims were plagued with hemorroids; it was <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the Lords hand. <hi>Mose<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> turnd the waters in Egypt into blood: <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> thought that but magicke; because his enchanters could doe that. But when lice came upon both men and beasts, the Enchanters them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves cryed, <hi>Digitus Dei est,</hi> it was the finger of God. The three dayes pestilence, which slew in <hi>Israel</hi> 70000. men, <hi>God sent it,</hi> the Text saith, and <hi>David</hi> cald it Gods hand. To end this, see in this <hi>Psalme</hi> how frequent the phrase is, from <hi>v.</hi> 43. to 51. <hi>Hee wrought, hee turnd, hee gave, hee destroyed, he cast, he smote, he sent</hi> (saith the <hi>Psalmist) evill angels among them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> cals wrath and vengeance <hi>alienum Opus,</hi> a strange Act, <hi>Esa.</hi> 28. 21. as if it were not Gods. But thats to show, how mercifull, how long-suffering the Lord is, how slowly, how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing he is drawne unto such acts, quicke to save, but slacke to punish. But marke his words, <hi>his</hi> strange worke, and <hi>his</hi> strange act, <hi>Alienum,</hi> but yet <hi>Suum,</hi> strange, but his. God joyeth more to sit upon his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy seat, then upon his Iudgement seat. But both the seats are his; <hi>Mihi Vindicta, I will revenge,</hi> saith God. I leave this Lesson, make but this use of it; Not to be impatient in any adverse accident; thats to mutine against God: Not to avenge our selves unduely upon the meanes thats to fight against God: against whom none ever fought <hi>vel Pie vel feliciter,</hi> either with religion or successe. Learne <hi>Iobs Benedictus,</hi> to cry even in Gods <hi>Abstulit,</hi> blessed be the Lord. Say at least, as old <hi>Heli</hi> said to young <hi>Samuel, Dominus est, it is the Lord.</hi> Strive to say in all accidents, be it welcome, what God sends; and thats the next terme in my Text▪ <hi>he sent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Evils come uncald, but not unsent. Are they not heere cald Angels? then are they sent; the word Angell meanes a messenger. Not things onely without life, but not living creatures neither, brute, nor men, not sathans selfe can hurt, unlesse God bid. The three daies darkenesse in <hi>Egypt</hi> how came it? <hi>He sent darkenesse,</hi> saith <hi>David, Psalme</hi> 105. So the haile, thunder, and lightning, the Lord sent them, saith <hi>Moses.</hi> The frogs, flies, lice, grashoppers, and caterpillers, that infected <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the Lyons that slew the Idolaters in <hi>Samaria, 2 King.</hi> 17. the Text saith of them all, <hi>Dominus immisit,</hi> the Lord sent them. And for Men, <hi>am I come</hi> (said <hi>Rabsakeh) without the Lord?</hi> he bad me goe. Yea the devill, the arch▪ evill angell, who seekes to devoure, yet must
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:173124:101"/> be sent, ere he can doe ought. The lying Spirit in the mouthes of the false prophets, longd to seduce <hi>Ahab,</hi> God must first bid, <hi>Egredere, goe forth,</hi> and doe so. The use of this is easie, without my helpe; Not to feare, doing well; Not man, fiend, any creature can hurt you, God not sending them. But sinning, to feare every thing. The weakest creature can quell the mightiest man, if God bid, goe. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a mouse (saith the Poet) will bite a wicked man. Be it proud <hi>Herod,</hi> great <hi>Antiochus;</hi> if God but aske the creatures, <hi>Quem mittam,</hi> which of you shall I send? the worme will answer, <hi>Ecce me,</hi> send me; I will devoure him. And such poore silie despicable creatures are some of these evill angels in my Text. <hi>He sent:</hi> what sent he? <hi>evill angels,</hi> the next thing in this Scripture.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Evill angels? Par dispar,</hi> a paire of words, which seeme not well matcht, the latter may say to the former, <hi>Quid mihi &amp; tibi,</hi> what have I to doe with thee? Angels were the best and holiest of Gods creatures. They all were good, very good, <hi>Moses</hi> saith; but Angels <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently good. Then is evill here, an evill epithet for Angels. And is never read but heere, and heere (some thinke) not well translated. But the phrase of evill angels hath other meaning heere: <hi>evill angels, i.</hi> the Angels, <hi>i.</hi> the messengers of evil. So is it in the Hebrew, not <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, but <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Insomuch that some expositors thinke the <hi>Psalmist</hi> meanes the words of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron;</hi> that they were sent from God, to be messengers of evill, <hi>i.</hi> of all the plagues that God would bring on <hi>Egypt.</hi> That sense I censure not, but follow not. The Greeke Fathers have an other, that by the evill angels are meant the evill Spirits; Christ cals them angels too, the devils angels. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> likes not that sence. The most current exposition is as a Iewish writer speakes, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the evill angels are the ten severall plagues. Shall I muster them?</p>
            <p>First all their waters turnd to blood, so <hi>noxious,</hi> that the fish dyed, and no man could endure to drinke it. The next, frogges, in their yardes, houses, kneading troughes, ovens, chambers, beds. Then all the dust of the land turnd into lice, infesting man and beast. Next, swarmes of flies, innumerable, in all roomes of all houses, as well the Kings as Subjects; that it infected the land. Then the murreine of beasts, such as all the cattle perished. Next, blaines and boiles on man and beast, throughout the land. Then the tempest of haile, such as smote every herbe, and brake every tree, with thunder and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that the fire ranne along the ground. Next, a multitude of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>custs, so many that they darkned the aire, and ate up the remainder of the herbes, which the haile spared; that there was not left a greene leafe on herbe or tree throughout all <hi>Egypt.</hi> Next to that, a thicke dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, that no one man saw another, nor stirred from the places where they stood for the space of three daies. The last and worst, the first borne dyed in every house, from the fitter on the throne, to the grinder at the mill, and the first borne of beasts also.</p>
            <p>These were the evill Angels; they were not evill Spirits. Tis true, that God smits men by Angells, not by evill Spirits onely, but by good
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:173124:101"/> Angells too, by their favour, that thinke otherwise. And it is an other wrong conceit, that evill Angells never touch good men. But that good Angells execute Gods wrath, and that both good and evill Spirits pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish both the wicked, and the godly too some times, wee finde in Scripture examples in all kinds. Lest, some may not beleeve mee; what Angell smote in Israell 70000. with Pestilence? <hi>Angelus Domini,</hi> the Lords Angell. Reply not, that an evill Spirit might be call'd so. None ever are so call'd. The Spirit that vext <hi>Saul,</hi> was <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritus à Domino, a Spirit sent by God,</hi> but not Gods Spirit. And for the other scruple; a good Angell made <hi>Iacob,</hi> lame, and <hi>Zacharie</hi> dumbe, righteous men both: and the like smote wicked <hi>Herod.</hi> And an evill Spirit both vexed <hi>Saul,</hi> and afflicted <hi>Iob.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the two words, learne two Lessons; the first, Gods <hi>Iustice,</hi> his <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the second, his <hi>Severitie,</hi> his <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Pauls</hi> termes both. God rewards sinne with paine. Paine wee account an evill; so is it called here: and if the sinne be great, hee aggravates the paine, either in the weight, or in the number. Evill is here Plurall, God sent <hi>Angelos malo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> messengers of evills, one plague after another. For the former, God being just, must (as S. <hi>Matthewes</hi> phrase is in the Gospell) <hi>Malos malè perdere,</hi> send evill upon evill men. He is not like to <hi>Virgils Iupiter, Omnibus idem,</hi> the same to all: but as <hi>Apollo</hi> is pictured with the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in one hand, and arrowes in the other; so God hath gifts for reward to good men, but shaftes for revenge on thy wicked. Sinnest thou, and tremblest not? <hi>Sequitur à tergo ultio,</hi> vengeance is at the heeles. <hi>Evill will hunt the evill doer.</hi> To doubt God to be just, <hi>Dementis est, August.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sinners (it seemes) doubt, would not else adventure. Nay, doth not Scripture warrant them? Saith not Gods selfe, <hi>Esay 27. 4. Iranon est mihi,</hi> I have no wrath? Hee doth▪ But whom speakes hee to? To the afflicted Israelites; hee hath none against them.

Hee is wroth with all; but this Verse saith, <hi>Pharaoh</hi> felt the <hi>fiercenesse</hi> of his wrath. He deserved it. His sinne was out of measure sinfull, incorrigible contumacie. Many were his plagues; for many were his contempts. Be pleased to heare them; they are worthy. <hi>Thus saith the Lord, let my People goe. Who is the Lord?</hi> saith hee, <hi>I will not let them goe.</hi> He would not, but used them farre worse then before
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:173124:102"/> Must they serve God? hee would make them to serve him. God then began to smite, all the waters became blood. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> then was content, they should serve God; but it should be there; goe forth they should not. God smote againe: then they should goe, but not farre. A third plague came: let them then goe, but the Men one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; their Wives and children should stay, be pledges for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne. A fourth: let Wives goe too, but not Children. A fifth: let Children goe too, but not their Cattell. A sixth: let them goe All, so he might be rid of that. But that done, he repents him, they shall not goe. Thus <hi>Pharaoh</hi> dallied with God; but God did not with him. The King hardned his heart, the Lord strengthened his hand. Sinne grew in waight, and the plagues grew in number, ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>l the Lord made an end of him.</p>
            <p>To end this, God corrects his childrens faults with the roddes of men, and the wicked haply too in their lighter sinnes with <hi>Solomons</hi> whippes: but for their Rebellions he hath a rod of iron, and <hi>Rehobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ams</hi> scorpions for the backes of Atheists. And for Number, if they shall dare goe on <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> from one evill to another; God will also pluralize, adde one plague unto another, God will vary judgements, if men shall vary sinnes. You have heard <hi>Egypts</hi> tenne plagues, God could have sent tenne times as many more. For there is not any Creature, which God cannot use to punish sinners. Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of plagues is often in the Prophets; <hi>feare, pit,</hi> and <hi>snare,</hi> in <hi>Esay,</hi> elegant in the Hebrew, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

            <p>There yet remaine two words, but written in small letters, as not found in the Originall. Translators have added them, to make the sense more plaine. Had they not, it had skild little; for they are before in the beginning of the verse; <hi>He cast upon them,</hi> is all one to say, <hi>He sent among them.</hi> Yea, <hi>He sent among them,</hi> sounds closer to the Hebrew. I will onely make use of them, for Application. <hi>Among them, i.</hi> the <hi>Aegyptians.</hi> Why did the French first institute these <hi>Rogation daies?</hi> because God sent evill angels among <hi>them,</hi> wilde beasts, and earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes, and strange fire from heaven. Why did <hi>Rome</hi> confirme them, because God sent evill angels among <hi>them,</hi> Inundation and Pestilence. And hath hee not sent evill angels among <hi>us?</hi> Why should our zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Brethren censure our yearely observing of these daies, and the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy</hi> assigned to them? Have not wee as urgent reasons to observe both?</p>
            <p>To passe by the dayes of our forefathers, our Chronicles may be credited, what befell them. Hath not God often in <hi>our</hi> dayes, in our land sent sundry evill angels, earthquakes, and fire from Heaven, as he did in France, Inundations and Pestilence, as hee did in <hi>Rome,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides murraine of cattell and extreame dearth? dyed there not of the Pestilence not many yeares since above 5000. persons in one City in one weeke? Did not the destroyer the very last yeare run through the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:173124:102"/> whole land, so waste some populous townes, that the living scarce sufficed to bury the dead? Twas for our sinnes, God sent him Aske you me for which? Some say, because Idolatry is committed in the land. But there are many other sinnes, for which God sends evill angels among us. Thats no pleasing theme neither, and this dayes Sermon heere is happly my last, I desire to part in peace.</p>
            <p>God heare our <hi>Te rogamus</hi> in our <hi>Rogation</hi> dayes, in all our daies of Fasts and Supplications, withhold his evill angels all, give true and speedy repentance to us all, blesse, preserve, and save us all, for his Sonne our Saviours sake, the good Angell of his Covenant, <hi>Iesus Christ, Cui cum Patre, &amp;c.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His time requires a Text of Prayer. Tis the <hi>Rogation</hi> weeke, the <hi>Procession</hi> weeke some call it, of the <hi>Letanie</hi> used to be read on these three dayes, which wee call the <hi>Procession;</hi> but the Latine Writers of Church-Ceremonies, <hi>Roga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones.</hi> For you have there twentie times, <hi>Te ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamus Domine, Wee beseech thee to heare us, good Lord.</hi> Be therefore pleased to heare the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Word of God, recorded by the blessed Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist Saint <hi>Iohn 16. 23. Verily, verily, I say unto you, whatsoever you shall aske the Father in my name, hee will give it you.</hi> Christs comfortable promise made to his Disciples, that God will graciously grant all their prayers. This promise he presseth with powerfull protestation; pawnes his Word, <hi>I say to you:</hi> addes his Oath, Sweares it too, <hi>Verily I say;</hi> doubles that Oath, <hi>Amen, Amen,</hi> I say it. But to that double Oath in the Preface, answers a double Provisoe in the Promise: the prayers must be made unto the Father in the sonnes name. <hi>Whatsoever yee shall aske the Father in my name, hee will give it you.</hi> Of these things, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>First, for the Preface. A Promise affirm'd onely is but weake, needs confirming too. Truth, though nere so sound, yet is oft doubted, and craves proofe. Christ to assure us, that wee shall receive, whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we shall aske, engages his owne Word, <hi>Dico vobis, I say to you.</hi> A word from some mans mouth is a weake warrant. As the man is, so is his word. If a King protest <hi>in verbo Regis,</hi> he will looke to be beleev'd; a Noble man will <hi>in verbo Honoris;</hi> a Cleargie man will <hi>in verbo Sacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotis.</hi>
               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:173124:103"/> What then will Christ? Not as a Noble man, though he were so, of the linage of <hi>David.</hi> Not as a King, though he were so too, <hi>King of the Iewes.</hi> Not as a Priest, though hee were so too, and that of the best Order, of the Order of <hi>Melchisedech.</hi> But as a Prophet. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets use not to leaze; they speake from God. Nay, as the Sonne of God, and so Gods selfe. Say, a Prophet may leaze; One did, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 13. 18. God <hi>doth not, Tit. 1. 2. Can not, Heb.</hi> 6. 18. Surely the Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion, thought not Christ was God, held him some man of God, some extraordinary Prophet of God; and yet cried, <hi>Dic verbum,</hi> prayed him but <hi>say the Word,</hi> that was enough. But as Christ said of <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> I may better say of <hi>Christ,</hi> he was more than a Prophet. The Word here saith the Word, the Word which was God, <hi>Dico vobis, I say to you.</hi> So the Word is Gods, and therefore sure. Heaven an dearth shall faile; Gods Word shall not. Christs <hi>Dico vobis,</hi> shall not faile, <hi>I say to you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Christ rests not in this; prefac't his Promise with his Word; prefaceth his Word too with an Oath. Christ knew mans incredulitie, had tried his Disciples to be <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, men <hi>of little faith,</hi> hee will secure them. Worthy was his Word, his bare Word of beleefe; twas band enough. But hee will bind it too. His Word bound his Promise; Oath shall bind his word, <hi>Amen I say to you. Iuratio est,</hi> tis an Oath, saith Saint <hi>Augustine.</hi> Many learned Divines thinke it is not. I contend not. Tis at least a vehement protestation; that will serve. It might them; let it us. Onely note; Oath or Protestation, Christ is earnest, doubles it, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver doubles it, in this Gospell, in none else; <hi>Amen, Amen, I say, to you.</hi> Leave the Preface; come to the Promise.</p>
            <p>Two Acts in it, Prayer on mans part, Hee must aske; Granting on Gods part, He will give. The Object common to both, <hi>Quodcunque, whatsoever.</hi> First of the Object. Once I noted before an excellent at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute, which Saint <hi>Iames</hi> gives to God, <hi>Iames</hi> 5. 11. Hee calls him <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, It is both <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiosa &amp; Copiosa,</hi> both free and franke. Free, for God sells not, but gives. Franke, tis not sparing, but liberall. Liberall? I wrong God; thats a terme too base for Him. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calls it <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

            <p>Kings, gods on earth will grant <hi>Quaecunque,</hi> whatsoever is craved of them. <hi>Salomon</hi> did to the Queene of <hi>Saba,</hi> whatsoever shee would aske. God will much more, can much better; Will, of his goodnesse, hee is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

But their <hi>Quaecunque</hi> hath many <hi>Excipees,</hi> is not like Gods, Infinite. Give all things, as God doth, absolutely all, Man will not, though he could, can not, though he would. Tis Gods Prerogative. Men, most men denie things when they be askt. The most Munificent, even Princes, call'd for their largesse, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, gracious Lords, <hi>Nedibim</hi> in the <hi>Psalmes, i.</hi> bountifull, send away their suppliants many times unsatisfied. It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:173124:104"/> recorded, that <hi>Gallienus</hi> the Emperour, <hi>nunquam quicquam cui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam,</hi> never denied any man any suite. Thats but said in <hi>Hyperbole,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he did it seldome. But <hi>Solomon</hi> denied his owne mother her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest. [So did Christ the mother of <hi>Zebedees</hi> children. Christ could not grant the one, <hi>Salomon</hi> would not the other.] Twas but a wife, his mother askt, and that for his owne brother. But he answered her anger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, you are best to aske the kingdome too. But aske God any thing, <hi>quodcunque;</hi> whatsoever, a kingdome, if you will, [not halfe a one, as <hi>Herod</hi> offer'd his stepdaughter, and <hi>Assuerus</hi> to his Queene; but a whole kingdome] God will give it. Christ hath said it, <hi>It is your Fathers pleasure to give you a kingdome.</hi> Earth hath nothing, Heaven hath not, which God will not grant, if man will but aske. Not <hi>quaecunque</hi> onely, but <hi>quotcunque</hi> too, how many things soever. The Greeke word is pregnant, may meane both, doth meane both. Bee thou strict in thy suite, in thy humility; God will be large in his grace, in his benigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; will give thee more then thou askest. He gives <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, richly, saith the Apostle. <hi>Salomon</hi> askt wisedome, God gave him it; and wealth and honour too. <hi>Iacob</hi> askt bread onely, and cloathes. God gave him that, and much substance besides. Men doe <hi>Iniquum petere, ut aequum ferant,</hi> looking for lesse, aske more in policie. But God in his bounty will give more, then man in his modesty may aske. Leave the Object, heare the Act.</p>
            <p>Theres another Act followes, tis Gods to give: but tis fit Man goe first to aske. Christ still so marshalls them. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, meerely superfluous. Hee does; thats his great gratiousnesse, travels so with goodnesse, that he will not stay the asking, prevents prayer: Like the prodigall sonnes father, runnes forth to meete him, kisses, &amp; imbraces him, before hee can speake to him. <hi>David</hi> prevented God, he sayes, <hi>Psal.</hi> 88. meanes, <hi>he rose early to pray.</hi> He must rise early, that will prevent God. But by <hi>Davids</hi> leave, God prevented him, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his spirit to pray; else he had not. <hi>Noveris te quaesitum antè, quàm quaerentem, Bern.</hi> God bids thee seeke; but seekes thee first; yea is found of thee unsought. <hi>Rom 10. 20. David</hi> confesses it, cries <hi>Praeveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sti, Psal</hi> 21. Gods blessings had prevented him. God gives men many things <hi>Nescientibus, Chrysost.</hi> they not aware of it. <hi>David</hi> prayed, the plague might cease, 2 <hi>Sam. ult.</hi> 17. God before had cryed <hi>sufficit,</hi> had bid the Angell hold his hand, vers. 16.</p>
            <p>But Gods prevention is no dispensation, quits not our duty. We must looke at his commandment, not his grace; doe what hee bids; hee bids us pray. God will open his hand; but man must open his mouth. Prayer must be mans Oratour, his Interpretor to God, to show him our requests, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saies, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 6. Now God needs none, you will say; he knowes our hearts. Hee does: yet he will have it so: and though he often gives unaskt; yet he lets us often want, because wee aske not. Saint <hi>

Wilt thou have <hi>Quodcunque,</hi> Gods any thing, Gods selfe? Aske it onely; thou shalt. God will not denie thee, no not the holy Ghost, <hi>Luc.</hi> 11. 13.

Christ cries upon the Crosse. To end this Act, the Act on our part, God will be askt, before he give. Hee will not give his Sonne his owne Sonne, the heathen for his inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, but he must first aske it; <hi>Pete a me, Psal. 2. Aske of me.</hi> Come we now to the Provisoes. It is the Father, must be prayed to; and in the Sonnes name. What is askt of any other, or in any other name, is out of this promise.</p>
            <p>For the former, who is this Father? It is Almighty God, <hi>Nemo tam pater, Tetrtul.</hi> the name is not so naturall to any, as to God. All In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation doth belong to God. Prayer is his propriety. I will not be so idle to prove this. I catechise not boyes, but preach to Men, many able to teach me. One Scripture shall serve this, <hi>Invoca me, call upon Me,</hi> saith God. But it is here, <hi>the Father.</hi> Is prayer proper to the first person onely? It is not. The Sonne doth claime it too; so doth the holy Ghost. It is common to all three. It is a point would not be past by, worthy our understanding.</p>
            <p>Some have thought, <hi>Origen</hi> did, some doe still, many Divines in <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary, Bellarmine</hi> saith, the <hi>Sabbatarii, Binius</hi> saith, <hi>tom. 4. p. 878.

Not to Christ, because he is <hi>Supplicator,</hi> no giver of grace, but an Intercessor onely, and prayers all are in his name. Not to the holy Ghost; because he is not God. The latter wee spit at; it deserves a stake, and <hi>Servetus</hi> had it, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">

               </gap> for it at <hi>Geneva.</hi> To
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:173124:105"/> the former I answer, Christs intercession puts him not by his right; does not un-god him. We may pray, though in his name, yet to himselfe. For Christ is Mediatour, not to the Father onely, but also to himselfe, and to the third Person. All three are God; and hee is Mediatour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Man and God.</p>
            <p>The first point positively; Reason and Scripture, and the Churches generall practise, yeeld invocation equally to all; to Christ, and to the Spirit, as well as to the Father. Reason; for they all are God; thats enough to claime prayer. <hi>Davids Invoca me,</hi> was from the mouth of all three Persons. For mostly in Scripture, when God is named, all three are signified. And by Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> conjoyning of Faith and Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, <hi>Rom, 10. 14. How shall they call on him, on whom they beleeve not;</hi> wee learne to pray to all the persons in the Trinity. For we beleeve on all. There are three Gods in our Service booke; and wee professe in all of them, our beleefe on all the three. For Scripture; was not Saint <hi>Stephens</hi> prayer, <hi>Lord Iesus, receive my spirit?</hi> Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> too, the <hi>Lord Iesus comfort your hearts, 2 Thess.</hi> 2. Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> too, <hi>Come, Lord Iesus.</hi> Yea Christs selfe saith here, <hi>whatsoever yee aske the Father,</hi> saith, <hi>Chap. 14. v. 14. Si petieritis me, If you shall aske me.</hi> Your bookes have it not so; but the vulgar Latin hath, and some Greeke Copies too. Where note againe <hi>Origens</hi> reason, &amp; the <hi>Hungarians,</hi> that Christs mediation debarres not invocation. If you aske <hi>Mee</hi> any thing in <hi>my</hi> name, saith Christ there. For the holy Ghost, Scripture is not so evident. But <hi>Esaies <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Holy, holy, holy, Esay</hi> 6. 3. sung by the <hi>Seraphims</hi> coucheth it covertly.</p>
            <p>For practise; the Christian Church ancient &amp; moderne hath used ever, still doth, prayer both to Christ, and to the holy Ghost. Looke in our <hi>Liturgie,</hi> the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creede (as we call it) saies, that the holy Ghost is <hi>Coadorandus,</hi> together with the Father, and the Sonne is to be worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped. More expresse in the <hi>Letanie,</hi> we cry not onely, <hi>O God the Father of heaven;</hi> but <hi>O Sonne of God,</hi> also, <hi>redeemer of the world;</hi> and <hi>O holy Ghost proceeding from them both, have mercy upon us.</hi> Both there, and elsewhere often, <hi>Domine miserere, Christe miserere, Domine miserere.</hi> In the <hi>Te Deum,</hi> we pray to Christ too, <hi>pray him, helpe his servants, whom he hath redeemed with his pretious blood.</hi> And in the singing <hi>Psalmes,</hi> the first is an Hymne unto the holy Ghost.</p>
            <p>Why then doth our Saviour here in my Text confine us to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Haply he does not. Hee doth not say, My Father, but <hi>the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> That terme implies rather Affection unto us, then relation unto Him; Affection of love, not distinction of persons. The appellation is equally common to all three. Say he doe; he meanes his Father but principally; but himselfe too, and the Spirit collaterally. He was pleas'd and it was fit, he should doe his Father all the honour that hee could; as not his father onely but the fountaine als<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of the Deitie. [Honour is the Fathers not Most, for <hi>Trinitas non habet gradum, Tert.</hi> no more his, then the others; nor his Most, but his First.] In a word, say <hi>Christ</hi> here said, his <hi>Father.</hi> yet that were but <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in his reverence unto him. But he must meane by <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> himselfe too, and the Spirit. To end this, prayer is here confind to the Father, that is, God. Not to
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:173124:105"/> seclude any person of the Trinity; but to provide in his foreseeing Spirit, against Popish Idolatrie, prayer unto Saints. A point which I may not passe by so opportuned. I will but touch it.</p>
            <p>Shall I pray to them, that heare me not? Or shall I make Saints gods, to heare in heaven, what is askt on earth? Say they can heare, though I muse how. The Papists say, Gods face is their Looking-glasse, they see all things done here, in it. Can they heare too, by a Looking-glasse? Good Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> never knew that glasse; saith, <hi>Nec vident, nec audiunt;</hi> Saints neither heare nor see, whats done in earth. But say they can heare; can they helpe too? Have they, what I want? If not, whence is the <hi>Dabitur,</hi> how shall it be given me, what I aske? Will they doe it by the Angells? They indeed are ministring Spirits; but not at their command It must be by mediation unto God; and the next words in my Text debarre that, bid mee aske in Christs name. Then heare they, helpe they, yea or nay, I will not pray to them. Doe I must not; what God bids not. Prayer to Saints, <hi>Iesuites</hi> themselves denie to be in Scripture. Not in the old Testament, saith <hi>Snares;</hi> not in the New, saith <hi>Salmeron.</hi> Tis then Will-worship, and so meere Superstition.</p>
            <p>Come to the next Provisoe, all prayer must be in Christs name. Thats to Christs glory, some glosse it so, thats somewhat lanke. Christ by his name meanes, for his sake; the best expound it so; and the Church doth practise it, ends all her prayers with, <hi>Through Iesus Christ our Lord.</hi> Christ saith it, not here onely, hath it often.</p>
            <p>Prayer must be in Christs name; <hi>Aske whatsoever,</hi> but through Him. Man is unworthy of accesse to God: he must have meanes. They are not many, one onely, it is <hi>Christ. Christ</hi> saith it, No man comes to the Father, but by Him. <hi>Christ</hi> is Gods onely Favorite; his Sonne alone preferres all suites. The Fathers selfe saith it, <hi>This is my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Sonne, in whom I am well pleased.</hi> Hee is our onely Patron, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith expresly, theres but one Mediatour, and that is, <hi>Iesus Christ, 1 Tim.</hi> 2. Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> too makes him our <hi>Advocate.</hi> Saint <hi>Peter</hi> shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it; he hath his Masters terme. Christ saith here, <hi>In my name;</hi> He, <hi>Non est nomen aliud, thers no other name</hi> but his. My length in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer point, makes me short in this. I would goe through all.</p>
            <p>Theres yet one terme, another Act, the Act on Gods part; tis to <hi>give.</hi> Christ addes it to mans Act, It was to <hi>aske;</hi> needs to adde it. For who will pray, but to be heard, aske, but with hope to speed? Heres more then, Hope, Assurance, Christs Word and Oath. Hope to speed, is a spurre to suite, an eare easie to heare, will have askers enough. <hi>Hee will give it you.</hi> The Doner, and his bountie. He; who He? The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>i.</hi> God. It must be Hee; none else can give, give whatsoever. And if God; it must be gift; for God sells nothing. God is gracious, and grace is free; goodnesse will give. <hi>Posse &amp; velle,</hi> Power and Will meeting, man cannot misse, aske he <hi>Quodcunque, whatsoever.</hi> Instance would be infinite of Gods gracious granting the humble petitions of Patriarkes Prophets, all men that have prayed to him.</p>
            <p>All men, but not all-wayes. Not Saint <hi>Paul</hi> sometimes, not <hi>David,</hi> nay not Christ. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> prayed, God would remove a pricke in his
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:173124:106"/> flesh, prayed thrice God would not. <hi>David</hi> prayed, God would spare the life of his sicke child, God would not. Christ prayed, the Cuppe might passe from him, the bitter potion of his Passion, askt it thrice too. God would not grant it, not the suite of his owne Sonne. For Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> God gave him not the thing, he askt; but he gave him as good a thing, a better thing, his <hi>Grace.</hi> The pricke in the flesh, was the devills poyson; but Gods grace was an Antidote. For <hi>David,</hi> God would not spare the child, for the chastening of the Father. For Christ, we can not say; Ood denied, what he askt: for he prayed but with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, <hi>If it▪ were possible;</hi> and with submission of his Will to Gods; askt life; but instantly correcting his request, unaskt it againe, revokt his petition. Christs prayer, happie be we he prest it not, and blessed be God, he granted not. Had not Christ suffered, we had; if not he on the Crosse, we had in hell.</p>
            <p>To conclude; Papists, plead not Merit, presse not price; buye no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of God. All things come from him <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

But in man tis no good manners to catch at Gods phrases captiously. He calls things, that are not, as if they were, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 17.

What God receives, is all <hi>De suo,</hi> Gods owne before. <hi>Bona</hi> be <hi>Dei Dona, Augustine,</hi> the good things of man, are the free gifts of God. God rewards not, paies not, sells not; but gives onely.</p>
            <p>Man deserves nought, is unworthy of grace. <hi>Indignus sum,</hi> saith <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, Gen. 32. Indignus sum,</hi> saith <hi>Iohn Baptist, Matth.</hi> 3. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> too, <hi>Indignus sum, 1 Cor.</hi> 15. A Schooleman can say so, God deales not <hi>Iuxta dignitatē humanam,</hi> but <hi>secundùm dignationē divinā.</hi> What we aske, we have; not of our deserving, but of Gods vouchsafing; of merit nothing, all of free gift. All things man hath, are <hi>Dei donativa, Tertullians</hi> terme, meerely Gods Donatives. <hi>Merita donat, praemia redonat, pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta condonat,</hi> all is Donation. <hi>Epicharmus</hi> a Greeke Poet saith, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

Such a multitude of Fish is caught, that the Net holds them not, but breakes. Nay, the Ship holds them not; they fill both it and another of their partners. Both hold them not▪ they fill them both, till they almost sinke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               <hi>him.</hi> A stranger reason, <hi>because he is a sinner.</hi> But though strange, yet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> not rude; but prefac't with a terme of honour, of religious reverence, <hi>Lord, goe from me,</hi> of these three in their order: first of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Domine, Lord.</hi> This terme in the three learned tongues is very am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> as in comom use, so also in Scripture; that it craves good descretion in the Preacher, or Translatour to English it aright. It hath both a religious, and a civill sense. There is <hi>Dominus Deus, the Lord God,</hi> and there is <hi>Dominus Rex, my Lord the King.</hi> Yea and not God onely, and his Lievetenants, Kings, are called <hi>Domini;</hi> but the terme descends even from the Scepter to the Spade; <hi>Domine,</hi> said <hi>Mary
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:173124:107"/> Magdalen</hi> to the Gardiner, as shee thought. S. <hi>Pauls</hi> speech fits here, there are many <hi>Domini,</hi> many Lords, both God and Men: and of Men, all sorts, even the meanest of Men in common compellation are called <hi>Domini:</hi> and therefore englisht diversly according to the different con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the persons; sometimes <hi>Lord,</hi> sometimes <hi>Master,</hi> sometimes <hi>Sir. Sarah</hi> cald <hi>Abraham, Lord. Rebecca</hi> gives the same title to his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, calls him <hi>Lord</hi> too. <hi>Art not thou my Lord Elias,</hi> saith <hi>Obadiah</hi> to the Prophet. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> poore Prisoners are calld <hi>Domini,</hi> by the Iaylour. So is <hi>Philip</hi> by the Greekes, <hi>Ioan.</hi> 12. 21. The places are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, in which this terme is given to Christ in the New Testament: not in the same sense ever; but according to the speakers present conceit of Christ. Master five times in the eight of S. <hi>Matth.</hi> in the <hi>Geneva</hi> Bible. Sir, thrice in the fourth and fift of <hi>Iohn,</hi> in the last Translation too. For the woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> and the <hi>Lazar</hi> of <hi>Bethesda,</hi> not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing who he was, gave him but the title of an ordinary man.</p>
            <p>But S. <hi>Peter</hi> a Disciple meanes it with more reverence. Yea espieing his divinity by the present Miracle, gives it him at least in the most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable acception that may be, to a man. And indeede howsoever in the Greeke and Latine tongues it be used unto men, even but of meane condition, in civility of speech: yet naturally it is a terme of highest honour; thought once too proud a title for the Emperour himselfe. <hi>Augustus</hi> refused it, forbad it, by publick edict. So did <hi>Tiberius</hi> after him, refused it too. <hi>Nero</hi> admitted it: you may see it in the <hi>Acts. Festus</hi> there gives it him. <hi>Domitian</hi> had <hi>Deus</hi> added to it too, <hi>Edictum Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni, dei{que} nostri;</hi> as proud as the Pope; our Lord God the Pope. It is indeed (<hi>Tertullian</hi> saith) <hi>Gognomen Dei,</hi> Gods owne appellation. That great name of Gods, his unutterable name, as the <hi>Rabbins</hi> call it, which the Iewes durst not, could not pronounce, the name <hi>Iehovah,</hi> the Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuagints ever interpret by this terme: proper to God onely; and not given (saith S. <hi>Hilarie</hi>) no not to Christs selfe, but <hi>Per id, quod Dei Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius est,</hi> as he is the Sonne of God.</p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Peter</hi> being here to speake unto our Saviour, must use some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation. All men doe. The King said so to his guest, <hi>Friend, how camest thou in hither? Ioab</hi> to <hi>Amasa, Art thou in health, my brother?</hi> It had beene unmeet, unmannerly to have cald Christ by his Name, the Disciple the Master. Sathan himselfe in the possessed, though hee cald him <hi>Iesus;</hi> yet it was with an adjection of honorable termes, <hi>Iesus, thou Sonne of God.</hi> Blind <hi>Bartimaeus,</hi> that could not say so much, cald him <hi>Iesus</hi> too, but with addition also of honorable words, <hi>Iesus, thou Sonne of David.</hi> Shall hee call him, Master? The Scribe cals him no more, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Master.</hi> So doe the Pharisees and Herodians, <hi>Master wee know that thou art true.</hi> So did <hi>Judas, Haile Master.</hi> Yea, <hi>Mary</hi> cald him Master too, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20. 16. for <hi>Rabboni</hi> meanes no more. His Disciples doe. One does, <hi>Mark. 13. See, what goodly stones are here.</hi> That one, not <hi>Iudas, Master, is it I▪</hi> He might haply be loath, as in the Oyntment, so also in his Titles, loath too much cost should bee bestowed on him. But even S. <hi>Iohn</hi> Christs beloved, <hi>Luk.</hi> 9. 49. Both hee and <hi>James</hi> his brother, <hi>Mark.</hi> 10. All his Disciples doe, <hi>Mark. 4. Master carest thou not that wee perish?</hi> But that terme contents not <hi>Peter;</hi> the sight of the
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:173124:107"/> Miracle, and the conscience of his sinnes, put an higher title in his mouth: he cals him, Lord. That other was too lanke and languid at this time. Publicans cald <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> so. S. <hi>Peter</hi> himselfe once cald him Master too; but hee was but <hi>Iohns</hi> disciple then; <hi>Master where dwellest thou.</hi> And Christs selfe allowes the title; <hi>you call me Master,</hi> saith he, <hi>and you say well, for so I am.</hi> And indeede it is a name of speciall reverence. <hi>Rabbi</hi> was the glory of the proud Pharisees.</p>
            <p>But Christs act here wrought in the Disciple a higher conceit of him then this title meanes: hee calls him, Lord. A title too given him by many. The Leper cald him, Lord. So did the Centurion; the two blind men, the Chanaanite woman, the Adulteresse, and others. All these cald him so in honourable conceit of him, as of some worthy Prophet, some speciall man of God. But Saint <hi>Peters</hi> conceit of him transcends all theirs; calles him here, Lord, in a Diviner sense. Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse both the Phrase and Gesture of a Suppliant. <hi>He fell downe at Iesus knees,</hi> and in the <hi>Syriacke</hi> Paraphrase <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Lord</hi> (saith hee) <hi>I beseech thee.</hi> Saint <hi>Peter</hi> makes more of him, then a meere man. For besides the workes of wonder, which hee had seene him doe; many and mighty, he had heard the devils call him the Sonne of God. Though Sathan be a Lyer; yet the witnesse of an enemy to the honour of his adversary, is ever authenticall. Yea and himselfe elsewhere confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth him so too, calles him the Sonne of God; saith, hee knew all things; which none doth, but God. And it is <hi>Calvins</hi> note upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Scripture, that we cannot rightly conceive Christ to be Lord, without instant conceit also of his Divinity.</p>
            <p>Nor is <hi>Peter</hi> herein, singular: Christ is cald Lord by more in the same meaning. By <hi>Mary Magdalene,</hi> shee said, <hi>she had seene the Lord.</hi> Shee must needes thinke him more then a meere man, whom by his owne power she saw risen from the dead. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> calles <hi>Mary the mother of</hi> her <hi>Lord. The Lord</hi> (saith <hi>David) said unto my Lord.</hi> Christs selfe is his expositour. Yea, an Angell cals him so; <hi>Math. 28. Come see the place, where the Lord was laid.</hi> Whom an Angell cals Lord, he must be God. Men are Lords, many; but onely over men: But Christ is Lord of Angels also. Conster one Angels meaning by another; <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briel</hi> said, <hi>Christ should be cald the Sonne of God.</hi> Saint <hi>Peter</hi> here cals our Saviour, Lord; not <hi>More communi,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> speakes, in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary notion, as we call many men; and as many used to call our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our: but as <hi>Calvin</hi> said, in a conceit of his Divinity. And in this conceit, the Apostles in their writings call him every where <hi>Dominum, the Lord.</hi> Yea we all, all Christians call him so▪ It is the close of all our Prayers, <hi>Per Christum Dominum nostrum. Through Iesus Christ our Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus Saint <hi>Peters</hi> word of Preface, you see the sense of it: now heare the Right of it; and so end it▪ Saint <hi>Peter</hi> flatters not, nor mistakes not. His successour <hi>cannot</hi> erre, in <hi>any</hi> thing: surely himselfe <hi>does</hi> not erre in <hi>this</hi> thing. Christ is Lord indeed: not by his Mother, because shee is cald our Lady, <hi>&amp; Partus sequitur ventrem,</hi> tis not that. Lord, first as God, and so his Fathers Pee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e. Then as Mediatour, by a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Right, of Inheritance, of Redemption, and of Wedlocke. <hi>David</hi>
               <pb n="196" facs="tcp:173124:108"/> saith of the first, <hi>God hath given him the Heathen for his Heritage, and the ends of the earth for his Possession;</hi> and <hi>Possessio</hi> is <hi>Dominium.</hi> For the second, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith too, he hath bought us for a Price; and the Law saith, <hi>Emptum cedit in Dominium.</hi> And for the third, the Church is Christs Spouse; and the Wife cals the Husband, her Head, and her Lord. I say, Christ is <hi>Dominus,</hi> both <hi>Natus &amp; Factus,</hi> Lord both borne so, and made so; Borne so, as God; Made so, as Man; Saint <hi>Peter</hi> saith it, <hi>Act. 2. God hath made him both Lord and Christ.</hi> Kings, all Kings are <hi>Christi Domini, the Lords annointed:</hi> here is <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus Dominus,</hi> the annointed Lord. Stil'd so by the Angell <hi>Luke 2. Who is Christ, the Lord.</hi> Enough of the Compellation: come to the Request.</p>
            <p>Strange words for a Disciple to speake unto his Master, <hi>Peter</hi> to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Christ; more then a Master, his Lord; the <hi>Messias,</hi> the Sonne of God. Thats more (you will say) then Saint <hi>Peter</hi> knew yet. Tis not. <hi>Iohn</hi> had taught it him, <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi> whose Disciple he was first, as it is thought. Say, he was not: yet his Brother had instructed him. <hi>We have found the Messias,</hi> saith <hi>Andrew,</hi> and brought him unto Christ. And himselfe saw his Divinity: at his first comming to him, a meere Stranger, Christ cald him by his name, and by his Fathers name. And he had seene his Miracles, Leapers cleansed, all diseases cur'd, devils expeld, <hi>Peter</hi> to say to him, <hi>Lord, depart from mee.</hi> That had cald him from the ship, to the Discipleship, from catching of Fish, to be a Fisher of Men; had graced him with his presence at his house; a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, which a better man then he thought himselfe unworthy of, the Centurion; had heald his Wives Mother of her Feaver; had honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him with the name of <hi>Cephas,</hi> marshald him next to his Kinsmen, <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn;</hi> loved him above them too, it seemes; for <hi>Iohn</hi> is cald but the Disciple, whom Christ loved; but Saint <hi>Peter</hi> was his <hi>Charis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simus, Tertullians</hi> terme, his best beloved. This man to say to Christ, <hi>Depart from me;</hi> should <hi>Festus</hi> judge him, as he did Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> he would say, <hi>Insanis Petre,</hi> certainely <hi>Peter</hi> thou art beside thy selfe. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Saint <hi>Peter</hi> sometimes spake he knew not what. At Christs Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figuration, <hi>Bonum est esse hic, let us make three tabernacles,</hi> Saint <hi>Marke</hi> saith plainely, <hi>he knew not what he said.</hi> When Christ foretold them of his Passion, <hi>Lord pitty thy selfe,</hi> saith <hi>Peter.</hi> Had Christ pittied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe; how should man have beene redeemed? how should <hi>Peter</hi> have beene saved? Christ might here have answered him, as he did <hi>Zebe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees</hi> Children, <hi>Ye know not what ye aske.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Say to Sathan, say to sinne, <hi>Depart from me. David</hi> does to sinne, <hi>a froward heart shall depart from me.</hi> The Sonne of <hi>David</hi> does to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, <hi>Vade, avoid Sathan.</hi> But to Christ, say every Soule, with the Spirit, and the Spouse in the <hi>Revelation, Veni Domine, Come Lord Iesus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>David</hi> prayes in the <hi>Psalme, Domine, ne discedas, Lord goe not from me;</hi> expostulates with God for leaving him, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou for saken me?</hi> But that you will say, toucheth not Christ. It doth, as he is God. But even the man Christ also, <hi>Iairus</hi> bids him, <hi>Come. Levi</hi> bad him to his house. So did they at the marriage in <hi>Cana.
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:173124:108"/> Zaccheus</hi> was so glad of his comming to his house, that for joy he gave halfe of his goods unto the poore: and yet he is called, <hi>Homo peccator</hi> too. <hi>Ioseph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> desired even his dead corpse, that he might lay it, where he meant to lie himselfe. The people pressed to Heare and see him; sought him, when they missed him, and held him (Saint <hi>Luke</hi> saith) when they had him. So farre fram this <hi>Discede,</hi> from saying, <hi>Lord, goe from us,</hi> that when he would goe, they permitted not; were so importunate, that they would not give him leave to take his meales. Yea <hi>Peter</hi> himselfe in an other passion, <hi>Matth.</hi> 14. 28. prayes Christ to bid him, Come to him, though walking on the water. Nay <hi>Iohn</hi> 21. he would not stay his bidding him: but Christ being on the shoare, <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> in the ship, casts himselfe into the sea, to get to him. For Christs presence is a preservative; from danger, the Disciples had perished in the tempest, had not Christ beene in the ship. <hi>Martha</hi> thought from death too: <hi>Lord, if thou hadst beene here,</hi> saith she, <hi>my brother had not died.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Church in the <hi>Canticles,</hi> (and they say Saint <hi>Peter</hi> is the Churches head) she longs for Christs presence, to see his face, to heare his voyce, to have his left hand under her head, and his right hand to embrace her: her delight under his shadow. What meanes Saint <hi>Peter</hi> to pray him to <hi>goe from him?</hi> A speech beseeming his Successour, rather the Pope, I would not wonder at him if he spake it. If Christ should come againe to live a while on earth, to rule his Church in person: the Pope would haply say, <hi>Domine discede, Lord depart from me.</hi> For being his Vicar, Christs personall presence would discharge him both of Office and Authoritie.</p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> desired to be with Christ, desired to be dissolved, for to be with Christ. Christs grant to the theeves prayer was but <hi>Hodie me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum eris,</hi> that he should be with him. For to be with Christ, is to be in happinesse. In his presence (saith <hi>David</hi>) is the fulnesse of joy. Thats (you will say) not to the point, to be with Christ in heaven. Surely tis not precisely. Yet <hi>Deus erat in Christo,</hi> as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, God being in Christ, he is in heaven, that is with him, with him where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever. As it is said of Sathan, <hi>Circumfert secum inferos,</hi> he carries hell about him: so where Christ is, heaven is, though it be on earth. Did the Queene of <hi>Saba</hi> hold them happie, that stood before <hi>Salomon,</hi> to heare his wisedome? Behold one greater than <hi>Salomon</hi> is here. They are happie, thrice happie, that stand before Christ, to heare the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous words, that proceede out of his mouth.</p>
            <p>What an unkind requitall is this request of <hi>Peters</hi> for his Masters love? Christs presence was precious: he loved them specially, with whom he chose to live, his domesticall Disciples. And of them S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and <hi>Boanerges</hi> most, he kept them ever neerest him; they three were often with him, when the rest were not. For <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> there was some reason; they were his Cozen-germans. But for S. <hi>Peter</hi> there was none, but only love. He both loved him more than the rest, you heard <hi>Tertullians</hi> terme, <hi>Charissimus;</hi> and also desired his love more than the rests, <hi>Simon</hi> (saith Christ to him) <hi>Lovest thou me more than these?</hi> And is <hi>Peter</hi> glutted with Christs love, quatred with his company? That hee
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:173124:109"/> praies him to go from him? saith <hi>John, Peter</hi> was of <hi>Bethsaida?</hi> It should seeme rather he was a <hi>Gergesen.</hi> The Maid, that chalenged him in the high Priests hall, had she heard him here speake in the <hi>Gadaren</hi> Dialect, <hi>Depart from me,</hi> would have said, <hi>Peter, thy speech bewrayes thee.</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any but the <hi>Gergesens,</hi> the prophane <hi>Gergesens</hi> bad Christ, Depart. They prefer'd their Hogges before their soules health. Nay <hi>Peters Soloecisme</hi> seemes worse then theirs. They had sustained some losse by Christ; <hi>Peter</hi> had gained by him. Their losse two thousand of Swine; his gaine two shipfulls of fish. Surely except <hi>Peter</hi> can show the better reason, the request is strange; let us heare it, <hi>Lord, depart from me: for I am a sinnefull man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Why must Christ goe <hi>from Peter?</hi> Because hee is a sinner. The request harsh, the reason worse. Should hee not speake absurdly, that should say to the Physitian, <hi>Domine discede,</hi> Sir, depart from me, for I am a sicke man? Sinne (saith Saint <hi>Basil</hi>) is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the soules sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; and Christ is the Physitian? The name <hi>Iesus</hi> so signifies, <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius</hi> saith. And saith <hi>Peter</hi> here, <hi>Domine discede,</hi> Lord, goe from me; for I am a sinnefull man? Surely tis a sicke argument: the Reason rather concludes the quite contrarie, for the Physitian; <hi>Domine accede,</hi> Sir come to me; for I am sicke: Lord, come to me; for I am a sinner. Twas Christs owne answer to the captious Pharisees, carping at his keeping with Publicans and Sinners, <hi>The whole have no neede of the Physitian, but the sicke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Argument is like his Net that brake; this as brittle. Where should the Physitian be but with the sicke? Where our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, but with sinners? Who were they, Christ said, <hi>Hee came to call, Matth.</hi> 9. 13. was it not sinners? Hee cries indeed else-where, <hi>Venite ad me omnes, Come unto me all.</hi> But those all are sinners. Tis <hi>Omnes,</hi> but <hi>Laborantes, All that are loden,</hi> over-loden with their sinnes. Art thou a sinner? Neither flie thou from God, as <hi>Adam</hi> did; neither bid Christ goe from thee, as <hi>Peter</hi> did. The Patient is safest, when the Physitian is beside him, <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 39. A woman, a sinner, <hi>Peccatrix,</hi> shee comes to Christ, stands at his feete, washes them, wipes them, kisses and annoints them. <hi>Zaccheus</hi> a sinner, <hi>homo peccator,</hi> Saint <hi>Peters</hi> terme here, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 7. You heard, how hee joyed, that Christ would be with him, would but take one meale with him. <hi>David</hi> a sinner, a great sinner; (be mercifull to my sinne, for it is great) yet cries, <hi>Domine, ne discedas, Lord goe not from me;</hi> Expostulates with God, for being so farre from him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 10. 1. Christ was not sent, but to the stray sheepe; and hee came to save that onely, which was lost. The sinner is both the stray sheepe, and the lost child.</p>
            <p>Were <hi>Peters</hi> reason good; then Christ must be with no man, no man with him. For all are sinfull men. Christ then must not crie, <hi>Venite ad me omnes,</hi> but <hi>Abite à me omnes,</hi> come unto me all, but depart from me all. But why, <hi>Because I am a sinner?</hi> May not Christ, and a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner be together without danger? To whether of the twaine accrewes it? Is the sinners companie contagious to Christ? Or occasions Christs presence any paine unto the sinner? First for Christs perill, there is none. The <hi>Leaper</hi> was to cry, <hi>I am uncleane, I am uncleane;</hi> lest
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:173124:109"/> any comming neere him might be hurt by his uncleannesse. But mans uncleannesse cannot defile Christ. The Sunne shining on a slough, is not fil'd by the slough; the slough is dried by it. Much lesse Christ, <hi>Sol justitiae, the Sunne of righteousnesse</hi> (so termed by <hi>Malachie</hi>) can be polluted by mans wickednesse. Our wickednesse corrupts not him; but his righteousnesse justifies us. The woman with the issue longed to touch Christ. Her touch hurt not him, but healed her. And for mans perill. It was an opinion among the Hebrewes, that if but an Angell appeared to any, he died for it. Wee shall surely die, saith <hi>Samsons</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and <hi>Gideon</hi> cried, <hi>Alas, for I have seene an Angell.</hi> If the sight but of Gods servant were so dangerous: what was the presence of Gods Sonne? Indeed the devills cried to Christ, <hi>What have we to doe with thee? art thou come to torment us?</hi> But Christs comming unto man (himselfe saith in the Gospell) is that sinners may have life, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> seconds him, <hi>Iesus Christ came into the world, to save sinners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Peter</hi> should have said rather, Lord keepe with me, for I am a sinner. Christs presence might be a protection against sinne. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> were parted, when <hi>Peter</hi> denied him. They were both in <hi>Caiphas</hi> Hall: but <hi>Peter</hi> was below among the servants. And Christ no sooner lookt at him, but he presently repented. Had <hi>Iudas</hi> kept with Christ, he had not betraied him. <hi>Exivit</hi> (saith the Evangelist) <hi>he went out,</hi> and sold him to the Priests. A Patient will be temperate, while the Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian is in presence. Surely sinne severs betweene God and man. <hi>Adam</hi> had no sooner sinned, but fled Gods presence. Sinne is a worke of darkenesse; and God is Father of lights. The sinner will not (with his will) come where he is. What Malefactor joyes in his Iudges compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie? God is the sinners censurer; he declines him. Now Christ to be God, Saint <hi>Peters</hi> selfe confesseth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 16. and wonder we, hee prayes him to depart from him? Christ is indeed God, but God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate: he came not to judge, but to save sinners. The <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed saith, he tooke flesh for our salvation. The Angell enclosed his nature in his name. He was God; but he was <hi>Iesus.</hi> What though <hi>Peter</hi> was a sinner? His Master was a Saviour. Hee therefore was called <hi>Iesus,</hi> because he would save his people from their sinnes.</p>
            <p>Why doe I all this while wrong the Apostle? Wrest his words unto the worst? Say both request and reason seeme to be absurd: it seemes, but is not. Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> bids, <hi>Dic &amp; tu,</hi> bids every Christian say it. And Christs answer consters it; bids him not feare. The meeke-hearted man amazed at the miracle, setting the Cogitation of Christs divine Majestie, to the conscience of his sinnes, finds himselfe unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of his sacred presence; and cries out in that conceit, <hi>Lord goe from me, for I am a sinfull man.</hi> For should Christs Godhead, maskt under his Humanitie, have appeared in kind; <hi>Peter</hi> must have perished. The justest man on earth, even <hi>Adam</hi> in his innocencie, must have instantly beene consumed. Gods hand must cover <hi>Moses,</hi> to see but his backe-parts: no man can see Gods face and live. How then shall <hi>Peter,</hi> a poore sinfull man, not tremble before him; not fall downe at his knees, and crie in his humilitie, <hi>Lord goe from me, for I am a sinner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Surely the speech is from Gods holy Spirit, acknowledging Gods
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:173124:110"/> might, and his owne meanes▪ unworthy the companie of so great a person, to stand beside him, to bee in shippe with him. Saint <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> is not singular in this neither. <hi>Domine, non sum dignus,</hi> the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turions cry, <hi>hee was unworthy, Christ should come under his roofe. Vnde mihi hoc, Elizabeths</hi> speech too; shee thought her selfe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, Christs mother should come to her. Nay Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> her sonne, a Prophet, more then a Prophet, as great as any that ere was borne of woman, yet held himselfe unworthy to untie Christs shoes. Neither <hi>Iohn,</hi> nor <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> neither the Centurion uses Saint <hi>Peters</hi> reason, because they are sinners; but onely in conceit of the excellencie of his person. <hi>Peter</hi> considering his sinfulnesse withall, hath the greatest reason to thinke himselfe unworthy of the presence of Christ.</p>
            <p>I thinke Saint <hi>Peters</hi> spirit be in some sort lighted on the Pope, on all Papists; They thinke themselves not onely unworthy of Christs presence, but they hold it impudencie even to pray to him, to him immediatly, they may not dare to goe to Christ directly; but must make the Saints their intercessours. <hi>Mary</hi> must mediate for them to her Sonne, Saint <hi>Peter</hi> to his master. And I wonder too, that among all their arguments for mediation of Saints, they cite not Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Action here, to proove men unworthy to pray to Christ directly.</p>
            <p>Wee Protestants erre in the certaine extreame. They are not so ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, but we are as audacious: Peeres to <hi>Peter</hi> for his sinne, but not for his conceit, who presseth not presumptuously into Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, into his Courts, unto his Altars, though nere so soild with unrepented sinnes? The <hi>Publican</hi> stood aloofe, would not looke up to heaven; but beat his breast, and prayed for mercy. I will not say, the sinfull man (wee all are so) but the wicked man, the libertine, the drunkard, the adulterer, the blasphemer, the extortioner, the will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full wicked man, not onely e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ters rudely into Gods house, but also goes on boldly even to his holy Table. That which the Fathers call <hi>tremendum mysterium,</hi> the blessed Sacrament of Christs blood and body, to which sinnefull man should not dare approach but with feare and trembling, hee never makes scruple of his unworthinesse, but confidently receives it. Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> said, <hi>Dic &amp; tu,</hi> bids mee say too with Saint <hi>Peter, Lord, goe from mee for I am a sinfull man.</hi> Not that I should forbeare the places of Gods presence, his speciall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, the Church, the house of prayer; many a lewd man would bee glad of that immunity: n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> nor his presence neither in the holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: but that when I enter them, waighing my sinfulnesse and his greatnesse, I hold my selfe unworthy to come into his presence. Wee publikely confesse it, when wee communicate, that <hi>wee are not worthy so much as to gather up the crummes under his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thou that wearest out all the weeke in strong drinke, or with strange women, in swearing and cursing, and all manner of lewd speaking, in beguiling thy brethren with false waights, and false measures, and which is worse, false protestations too, and presumest on the Lords

But in some sinister sense, in the spirit of despaire, as if Christ were not thy Saviour, but thy Iudge; say it not so. Bid not Christ <hi>goe from thee,</hi> because thou art a sinner. For therefore he comes to thee, because thou art a sinner. That which is thy argument for shunning him, is Christs argument for saving thee. Embrace thy Physitian; put him not away. Bee thy sicknesse whatsoever, hee will make thee whole. Thou art <hi>homo peccator, a sinfull man,</hi> but he is <hi>homo non peccator,</hi> a man without sinne. His righteousnesse will cover thee, <hi>Cui, &amp;c.</hi>

            <p>The subject matter of this Song is <hi>Salvation.</hi> This word in the Latin Text, <hi>Salus Deo,</hi> and the <hi>Ellipsis,</hi> the want of the verbe in the Greeke and Latin both, might move some scoffing Atheist to floute both Saints and God, and say, the Saints wish health to God. An im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious, absurd, and irreligious sense. Wee wish health and salvation, bodies health, Soules salvation one to another; not to God; he needs neither, is himselfe salvation. The people of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to the Iewes in <hi>Egypt, salutem,</hi> greeting and health, 2 <hi>Macch.</hi> 1. 10. the phrase is frequent there. It were grosse complement to greet God.

The Saints ascribe their salvation unto God. It is here an Hebraisme, this booke hath many▪ The very same in the third <hi>Psalme v. ult <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

                  </gap> Salus Domino, salvation to the Lord,</hi> that is, belongs unto the Lord. Of that afterwards; it is the Praedicate of the proposition; first of the subject.</p>
            <p>All mans good is from God; temporall, riches, health; spirituall, grace and peace, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, all things, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, saith it thrice. But above all things, <hi>salvation.</hi> It is but <hi>Salus,</hi> in Latin, too weake a word, to signifie so much. It meanes but health and wealth, incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon speech, worldly prosperity, as does in Scripture the word Peace, in ordinary salutation. Salvation is a heavenlier, a diviner thing, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, saith a Greeke father, the greatest and the royallest of all the gifts of God. <hi>Nihil tam dignum Deo,</hi> nothing (saith <hi>Tertullian</hi>) so worthy God, as mans salvation. Mans creation a great worke; sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation a far greater, cost God more paines. His breath suffis'd to make the soule, but his death required to save it. Two notes here needefull, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, first, that it is; then what it is.</p>
            <p>For the one, that the soule shall be saved, all confesse not. That it is Immortall, some make doubt, some quite deny. That it dies with the body, heathens have held many, Atheists all, Christians some, in <hi>Arabia.</hi> One or two Bishops of <hi>Rome,</hi> Pope <hi>Paul</hi> 3. and <hi>Iohn</hi> 23. This is so grosse an heresie, and the soules immortality so generally now beleev'd, that to spend speech in proofe, were to mispend time. Scriptures are rich in it; yea reason would evict it, were they silent. But soules though all immortall, are not all saved. Christs selfe, that saves them, saith, hell receives moe soules, then heaven. That some shall bee, who doubts? a great summe; Iewes here 144000, Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans without number, vers. 4. and 9. God to show the world, that hee
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:173124:112"/> was mercifull, as well as just, though all men sinned, yet would not have all death, but some Salvation. Why was Christ else Incarnate? <hi>for us Men,</hi> saith the <hi>Creed, and for our Salvation. Natus est, &amp; Datus est, Esay</hi> 9. 6. that he was borne in the wombe, torne on the Crosse, why was it but to save us? He was named Iesus, for that act and end. An Angell tels us, that signifies salvation.</p>
            <p>For the other, what is Salvation? It needs no definition, a knowne terme, in the usuall acception. The English word is straight, meanes lightly but deliverance from Hell, and eternall life in Heaven. But the Greeke and Latine are more large; they meane deliverance too; but not spirituall onely, from sinne and death, but temporall also, from any kind of Crosse, present or imminent. And so is the sense of salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in my Text; the Saints ascribe to God all sorts of deliverance. The soules escape from death, and happinesse in Heaven, is the maine salvation, and is so termed <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. But the other are salvations too, and cald so, though not commonly. Preservations are salvations. <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs</hi> escape from <hi>Esaus</hi> sword, the Hebrewes from <hi>Amaleks, Davids</hi> from <hi>Sauls,</hi> and <hi>Absalons, Peters</hi> from <hi>Herods, Pauls</hi> from many perils, were all salvations. Such temporall deliverance, in the booke of <hi>Psalmes</hi> is often Englisht salvation. Even such salvations the Saints ascribe to God. <hi>David</hi> doth often. <hi>Ionahs</hi> deliverance out of the Whales belly, he cals it his salvation. The Saints are said to sing <hi>cap.</hi> 15. 3. the song of <hi>Moses.</hi> That song is of salvation, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15. 2. of salvation in this sense. God had saved <hi>Israel</hi> out of the handes of the Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</p>
            <p>Come we now to the Saviour; it is God. The blessed Virgin cals him so, saith her <hi>Spirit rejoyceth in God her Saviour,</hi> Saints on Earth, as well as Heaven, sing salvation-songs to God. <hi>Iob</hi> cals God his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. So doth <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Esay,</hi> and <hi>Ieremie,</hi> and other Prophets. <hi>Saul</hi> does, though no Saint. <hi>Darius</hi> too, though a Gentile. God cals himselfe so, <hi>Esa. 43. 3. I am thy Saviour.</hi> If he be; then salvation is his. His, not <hi>Possessive,</hi> but <hi>Effective,</hi> Gods Act. To this beare all the Prophets witnesse, and other Holy men, <hi>Ioseph, Sampson, Iona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, Solomon, Peter, Paul,</hi> that salvation is Gods Act. <hi>Davids</hi> phrase indeed, <hi>Psal.</hi> 3. 9. is <hi>Salus Domini,</hi> which some will say, sounds passive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. But who knows <hi>Davids</hi> sense, better then <hi>Davids</hi> selfe? Hee is his owne scholiast, <hi>Psal. 37. 39. Salus a Domino.</hi> That saith plainely, tis his Act.</p>
            <p>This theme should seeme to need no proofe. Who but a profest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theist, will once doubt of it? that salvation is of God, that beleeves, there is a God? Onely the Epicure grants, God is, but is idle, busies not himselfe with the affaires of mortall men, leaves them to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. But of this foolish sect, <hi>Plena sunt Omnia;</hi> Who is not an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure? even the most religious man is one sometimes. The whole world ascribes salvation, I meane, Preservation, meerely to meanes. Every man robs God of his Prerogative, makes himselfe his owne Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. The greatest Persons most. They thinke policy protects them, not Religion; put their confidence in <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

            <p>But all these things, all other, are (as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith) <hi>Adjutoria deceptoria,</hi> deceitfull saviours. Salvation is all Gods. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they save sometimes, oft times; but as God meanes. One man may be Gods instrument, to save another, any Creature may. But the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of salvation is Gods selfe. If he move not the instrument, blesse not the meanes; theres no salvation. Nay the supposed meanes of our safety sometimes become our bane. Did never King thinke Iesuites would secure his Crowne, and at last was slaine by them? No man, no Creature saves, but as Gods Instrument. It pleaseth him, to make them his meanes of our salvation, still I meane preservation. <hi>Ioseph</hi> was named by <hi>Pharaoh, Saphnath happaneath,</hi> thats, saith Saint <hi>Hierom, Salvator mundi,</hi> because he saved, <hi>i.</hi> preserved the land. Hee did, both it, and others from the seaven yeares famine. But <hi>Ioseph</hi> ascribes that Salvation to Gods selfe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 45. 5. From sword, from pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, from famine, from all hurt, it is God, that saves man, God onely. Even sometimes without meanes, by miracle. How many were delivered from sundry infirmities by Christs onely Word? Who, or What saved the <hi>Hebrews</hi> at the red Sea, from the <hi>Egyptians?</hi> Who, or What, <hi>Ezechias</hi> and his people from the <hi>Assyrians?</hi> Who, or What, <hi>England</hi> from the <hi>Spanish Invasion,</hi> from the Iesuites <hi>Powder plot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For Spirituall Salvation, theres lesse Question. All men give that to God. They doe; but not God onely. Papists in that too doe rob God, make the Saints Saviours too; cry <hi>Sancte Petre, salva nos,</hi> Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> save us, Mother of God, save us. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> maintaines it. Say not, they meane them interceding Saviours onely, to procure Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to us by their Prayers. They cannot mumme under that maske. They make them Mediators, not <hi>Intercessionis,</hi> but <hi>Redemptionis</hi> too. They would faine use that distinction. But they are so brazen browed, that they father on Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> this sacrilegious blasphemy, that the Saints have wrought our Salvation by their blood; that the Saints were <hi>Sacra hostia,</hi> a propitiatory sacrifice. Why should they not? The Saints in this songe, say not, <hi>Soli Deo,</hi> unto God alone, but barely <hi>to our God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, for that forg'd saying of Saint <hi>Ambrose,</hi> the Pope himselfe shall confute that popery. Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the first, <hi>Nullius Sancti Occisio, propitiatio est. Ipse solus est hostia.</hi> No Saints blood is <hi>propitiatory,</hi> Christ alone is the Sacrifice. And for the Why-not, the Popes speech answers that too. For Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> saith no more, then <hi>Ipse est propitiatio.</hi> Christ is the propitiation for our sinnes. Hee saith not, <hi>Ipse solus.</hi> Yet <hi>Leo</hi> puts that to. He knew, he meant it so. So might the Papists heere (were they as ingenuous, as Pope <hi>Leo</hi> was) supply the word supprest, and understand, <hi>Soli Deo,</hi> Salvation to God onely. <hi>Moses</hi> said no more, then <hi>Thou shalt serve the Lord thy God, Deut.</hi> 6. But Christ cites it to Sathan, and puts, <hi>Soli,</hi> to it, <hi>Him onely shalt thou serve. Matth.</hi> 4. 10. Sathan might have replied, that (onely) was not there. But he
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:173124:113"/> knew, <hi>Moses</hi> meant it. Gods owne words warrant it, <hi>I will not give my Glory to another.</hi> What is ascribed to God, is meant to him alone, and is proper to him onely. <hi>Every good gift</hi> (and is there any better then Salvation?) Saint <hi>Iames</hi> saith, <hi>comes from above.</hi> Thats not enough: it may come from the Saints so. Hee there<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, theres but one God. <hi>Si non unus est, non est, Tertul.</hi> either but one, or not one. False gods there are many, the god of <hi>Eckron,</hi> of <hi>Hamath,</hi> of <hi>Arphad.</hi> Every Nation had one; every City one, <hi>Jer.</hi> 11. 13. Gods selfe saith, hee is <hi>Alone, Esa.</hi> 45. The Saints here therefore call him Their God; <hi>Salvation to our God.</hi> Thats one reason for the word added here, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Distinction. An other is of Covenant. God Covenanted with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> to be, his God, and the God of his Seed: which seed are these Saints, All Saints. Not <hi>Isaac</hi> onely and <hi>Iacob,</hi> and his seed; but all the Faithfull, borne whensoever, wheresoever, are the sonnes of <hi>Abraham,</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, and may call <hi>Abrahams</hi> God, their God. But yet this God, though one, <hi>Vnissimus,</hi> Saint <hi>Bernards</hi> word, is (I may not say) divided, but distinguisht into Persons, three Persons; and all three lightly meant, when God is named. But here the first, the Father, described by a marke of Majesty, sits on a <hi>Throne.</hi> For hees a King, thats frequent in Scripture, a great King, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. a King of Kings, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 19. and hath therefore there many Crownes. Other sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry <hi>Regalia</hi> Scripture hath, I omit them. My Text cites but a Throne. and why that?</p>
            <p>Is the Throne proper to the Father onely? Hath not Christ a Throne too? He hath; and in this Booke, the Throne is oftener said of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Sonne, then of the Father. Or haply are they differenced thus, the Father to sit, the Sonne to stand? For so tis said, <hi>chap.</hi> 5. 6. the Lambe stood. So Saint <hi>Steven</hi> saw Christ standing. But here the Father sits. The Question is not idle. It is a Stone, some Heretickes have stumbled at. The Father to have a Throne, and not the Sonne. Or if both have; yet the One to sit, the other to stand, argues Inequality. Thats it, <hi>Arius</hi> would have, and other heretickes, the Sonne to be the Fathers Inferiour. But Regall Majesty meant by the Throne, is the same in both, <hi>Vnus Thronus, vna Majestas,</hi> theres one Throne of the whole Trinity. The <hi>ver. penult.</hi> of the last Chapter, and the first of the last, are plaine for two of them, that Christ and his Father sit on the same Throne; hath a Throne as well as he, and sits as well as he. All Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Creeds have it, that <hi>Iesus Christ sits at the right hand of his Father;</hi> have it from the Scriptures, many Scriptures. I speake to many here,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:173124:113"/> that are not learned. I must explaine my selfe, lest I lead them into er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. Scriptures for our capacities speake many things of God unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, expresse the things of God, by the phrases of men, make God like one of us. Give him our parts, hands, eyes, eares, feet; our actions too, to stand, walke, sit; passions too, griefe, anger, jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie. This occasiond some Heretickes to hold, God hath a Body. God hath no Throne indeed, nor sits. Such termes are <hi>metaphores</hi> or <hi>metonymies</hi> all, used for our understanding. Gods <hi>Throne</hi> meanes his Majesty, and his <hi>sitting,</hi> his Authority; <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, it signifies his Dignity, saith <hi>Athan.</hi> Hee sits not <hi>Corporaliter,</hi> not <hi>Carnaliter,</hi> Saint <hi>Augustines</hi> words. His <hi>Sedere,</hi> is <hi>Praesidere,</hi> his <hi>Sitting</hi> notes his <hi>Power,</hi> and his <hi>Throne,</hi> his <hi>Glory.</hi> And Christs sitting by his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, showes his parity of power, equality of Majesty; or, as saith <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanasius,</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, Consubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality.</p>
            <p>To end this, what meant the Saints to describe the Father here by his session, and his Throne? Why doe they not distinguish him from the Sonne, and holy Ghost, by some propriety? For Throne and session, <hi>i.</hi> majesty and power are common to all three. You shall oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times observe, even where the Persons are distinguisht, some Acts, or Attributes, common to them all, to be given unto one. In the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the <hi>Letanie</hi> we petition every Person apart, style the first, <hi>Father of Heaven.</hi> Are they not so all three? Some, that like not our <hi>Liturgie,</hi> will easily yeeld, it is a fault. The Apostles <hi>Creed</hi> cals God <hi>the Father Almighty, and Maker of Heaven and Earth.</hi> Both Sonne and Holy Ghost are so: Is the <hi>Creed</hi> faulty too? Heare therefore Christ, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 21. He cals his Father, <hi>Lord of Heaven and Earth.</hi> So it is here. A Title common to the whole Trinity is affixt unto the Father. The Sonne to sit on Throne, you heard before, and of the Holy Ghost, Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> saith, <hi>Considet,</hi> He also sits with them. I have beene long in this; the Saints proceed, sing salvation to Christ too.</p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> saith, the <hi>Iewes,</hi> by the name of Saviour, ever meant <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> God the Father, Here 144000. Iewes sing salvation to the Sonne. But by what Name? Among Christs many titles and names, which it skils not to mention, they make choise of the Lambe. That name <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> like an Herauld proclaimed openly two dayes together, and that with an <hi>Ecce, Behold the Lambe of God.</hi> It best fits the Saints song; because he being sacrificed to his Father, as a <hi>Lambe,</hi> wrought their salvation. The <hi>Lambe,</hi> both in the Passeover, and in the daily sacrifice, prefigur'd Christ. That Reason is not all; for the goat and bullocke did that too. But the <hi>Lambe</hi> of all the beasts is the meekest, and most harmelesse. Christ would be cald the <hi>Lambe,</hi> for his innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and humility. The Prophet notes the one, <hi>Luke a Lambe dumbe before the shearer, so opened he not his mouth,</hi> and Saint <hi>Peter</hi> for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, calls him <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

<pb n="208" facs="tcp:173124:114"/> an Article. For some other are called Lambes, wee are, <hi>Feede my Lambes,</hi> saith <hi>Christ</hi> to <hi>Peter.</hi> But Christ is called so <hi>Singulariter,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Augustine.</hi> To this Lambe Saints have cause, all Saints have speciall cause to sing Salvation, soules Salvation. Temporall Salvation, <hi>i.</hi> Preservation comes equally from every person in the Trinitie. But for spirituall salvation, Christ thinkes it no robberie, to claime the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest thankes. For the Father and the Spirit, did but Decree, and Order it. The Sonne besides, tooke flesh; <hi>Exinanivit,</hi> emptied himselfe, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was bold to say so. Not that taking our nature, he resigned his owne, relinquisht his Divinitie. But he humbled himselfe, supprest his Godhead, made himselfe man; would be borne of a woman, brought forth in a Stable, cradled in a Manger, suffered persecution in his Infancie, povertie all his life, and toward his end contempt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, reviling, all indignitie, all extremity, even death, death of the Crosse; bare all this, as a Lambe, <hi>Agnus mansuetus,</hi> a meeke Lambe alwayes, but then <hi>Agnus occisus,</hi> a Lambe slaine for a sacrifice, to be offered up to God, for the sinnes of the world. So hee wrought our salvation. I will not presse comparison too much betweene the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, touching our salvation. I may not with sobrietie. I will rest in Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> word, for it is a weighty one; <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 10. he calls Christ <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the <hi>Prince of our salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A corrosive to the Devill, great disparagement, a Lyon to be van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisht by a Lambe. For it was his hands, his pawes, his jawes, that Christ hath saved us from. A <hi>live dogge (Salomon</hi> saith) <hi>is better than a dead Lyon.</hi> But here a living Lyon is queld by a dead Lambe. A Lambe, but yet Lyon too. This Booke, in which he is called a Lambe so often, calls him a Lyon once, <hi>Chap. 5. 5. The Lyon of the Tribe of Iudah.</hi> If any muse at it, how Christ should be both, Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> answers it, <hi>Agnus in passione, Leo in resurrectione,</hi> he died a Lambe, rose a Lyon. His Resurrection was his Triumph over Death, Sathan, and Hell.</p>
            <p>To end this, the Saints ascribing <hi>Salvation unto God, and to the Lambe,</hi> exclude all other Saviours. The Saints themselves are none, you heard before. Salvation (Saint <hi>Iames</hi> said) was <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, from above, but <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, from God. Not from the Spirits, who are men; but from the Father of Spirits, who is God. Much lesse are Merits, which Papists reckon too; Thats worse than the other. For then salvation is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, from below. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> is too plaine for that, <hi>Theres no Name under heaven, by which we may be saved.</hi> In a word, theres no name under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, nor in heaven neither, to which wee may ascribe salvation, but God onely; but <hi>God that sits on the Throne, and the Lambe,</hi> theres no more. Iudge then how sacrilegious Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth was, who in the <hi>Laterane</hi> Councill let one title him his Saviour. Gods selfe shall determine (by the Popes leave) this Question, <hi>Esay 43. Non est salvator praeter me, theres no salvation</hi> in no sence, <hi>but from God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To end all. To God, thats sits upon the Throne, and to the Lambe? Where is the holy Ghost? Doe the Saints exclude him too? God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid. Non-expression is not exclusion. Gods Spirit, whom we may not teach to speake, taught these Saints this song. I may not say of them, as it is said of <hi>Peter</hi> at <hi>Christs</hi> Transfiguration, that hee spake, hee
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:173124:114"/> knew not what. The blessed Spirits wot well that the persons are Peeres in mans salvation. They knew that of the Schoole, though they never went to it, <hi>Opera Trinitatis ad extra</hi> be <hi>Indivisa.</hi> The Actions <hi>ad intra,</hi> to Beget, to be Begotten, to Proceed, distinguish Father from Sonne, Sonne from the holy Ghost, each Person from other. But Creation, Preservation, Redemption, Salvation, all workes <hi>Emanan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> that goe out unto the creature, are common to all three. Had the song beene but thus, Salvation to the Lambe: that had beene no exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Father. So neither this ascribing of salvation to two Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, God and the Lambe, shuts out the holy Ghost. It pleaseth the Spirit to name sometime God onely, then all three are implied. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time two of the Persons; then the third is understood; and sometimes to expresse all three. It is all one. For the Sonne is in the Father, he in him, the Spirit in both, both in the Spirit. What is therefore done to one, is meant to all. The like place to this here (lest you thinke it hath no parallels) is <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. 3. and it is Christs owne speech to God, <hi>This is life eternall, to know thee, the onely true God, and whom thou hast sent, Iesus Christ.</hi> Say, the Saints might neglect or forget the holy Ghost, which to say, were absurd: yet Christ did not, could not. To say that, were impious. Now then unto our God, that sits upon the Throne, and to the Lambe, and also to the Spirit, be jointly and justly ascribed all salvation, Power, Majestie, and Thansgiving, <hi>nunc &amp; in secula.</hi>

For it is Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> question, <hi>How should they beleeve on him, of whom they had not heard?</hi> His fame indeed went forth; but to the neighbour-regions onely. And how should they heare without a Preacher? When he sent forth his Apostles to Preach of him abroad, he forbad them to goe into the way of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> As for those, that lived since, as they have had no sight of him; so have they had no faith on him; I meane the most. The word which breedeth it, hath beene preached abroad; the sound of the Gospell hath beene heard into all lands.

Who hath beleeved</hi> the <hi>report?</hi> Though many Lands be Christians, yet many moe be Infidels.</p>
            <p>And what I say of <hi>Gentiles,</hi> I may also say of <hi>Iewes.</hi> They were not all beleevers, that lived before Christ came; and almost all have beene unbeleevers, that have lived since he came. What shall I now say con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this first sort, both of <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles?</hi> Shall I call them all accursed? I had much rather stand on mount <hi>Garizim,</hi> than mount <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal.</hi> But by proportion from my Text, I can not call them blessed. Christ holds them blessed, onely that beleeve. I know some ancient Fathers, and divers later Writers, hold many Heathens saved not by Faith, but by Philosophie: such of them, as have lived religiously and justly, and have excelled us Christians in exactnesse of a good life. <hi>Quis me constituit judicem?</hi> I will neither curse nor blesse them. It is a fitter point to be discust in Schooles, than decided in a Sermon. But for the rest (for there were but few of these) deniers of God, and defiers of Religion, by rule of Contrarietie, Christ holds them cursed.</p>
            <p>To end this first part; <hi>Thomas</hi> the Apostle, though he saw our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour and beleeved to; yet in some sort may be rank't in this first or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Christs resurrection he had not seene, nor did beleeve it. Nay he resolved peremptorily, that except <hi>he saw Christ,</hi> he would not beleeve. Nay except he <hi>felt</hi> him; the <hi>print</hi> of the wounds in his <hi>hands</hi> and in his
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:173124:116"/>
               <hi>side,</hi> except he <hi>felt them with his fingers,</hi> hee would not beleeve. But I reserve him rather for an other ranke; because a litle after he both saw him, and beleeved. So much for the first sort.</p>
            <p>The second shall be those▪ that have seene, but not beleeved. The Scribes and the Pharisees, the Lawyers and the Sadduces, the Elders, and Herodians, <hi>Herod,</hi> and <hi>Pilat, Annas,</hi> and <hi>Caiphas, Iudas Iscariot,</hi> and the railing theefe, and all the route of those, that cried <hi>Crucifige,</hi> and that mockt him on the Crosse, are of this ranke. What shall I say of these? Not, as <hi>Balaam</hi> said of <hi>Israel, How shall I curse, where God hath not cursed?</hi> But how shal I not curse, where Christ hath curst before me? Woe unto you Scribes, woe unto you Pharisees, woe unto Lawyers, woe unto the man, by whom the Son of man is betraied. Woe on earth, Gods indignation; woe in hell, his condemnation. For the lake which burnes with brimstone is the lot of unbeleevers, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 21. As the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews could not enter into earthly <hi>Canaan, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, for their unbeleefe:</hi> so they should not enter into heavenly <hi>Canaan,</hi> for their unbeleefe.</p>
            <p>They that heard of Christ, but saw him not, and therefore beleeved not were somewhat to be pardoned. Fame hath so little conscience in forging lies, that the eare is not beleeved. It must be the eye, that must perswade the heart. <hi>Iob</hi> termes the eare the taster of speech; but we hold the eye the trier of truth. But not to trust that neither is great increduli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Nay the eare also deserves to be credited, when the report is secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with reason. Had the Scribes &amp; Pharisees but only heard of Christ; yet the fame confirmed by the writing of the Prophets, &amp; observing all circūstances suting with the same, there was cause they should beleeve. But seeing him themselves, daily in the midst of them; not to beleeve, that which they did behold, was desperate diffidence, was unpardonabe, unreasonable, unconscionable, infidelitie? Worthy to be wondered at even by God himselfe. So saith the Evangelist, <hi>Mar.</hi> 6. 6. our Saviour <hi>wondered at their unbeleefe.</hi> Christ, whose name is <hi>wonderfull,</hi> whose workes are wonderfull; to whom (as saith himselfe, <hi>Gen. 18.) <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

                  </gap>, Nothing can be wonderfull,</hi> yet he wondred at their unbeleefe. Their unbeleefe worthy to be wondered at, especially the Elders, the Scribes, and the Pharisees, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Masters in Israel,</hi> and Doctors of the Law, to be so witlesse, so senselesse, not to conceive, what they saw; nay not to see, what they beheld; and consequently not to beleeve, what they conceived.</p>
            <p>How many meanes did God vouchsafe that people, what infinite hints to helpe their unbeleefe! The Wise men of the East had told them <hi>Christ was borne,</hi> and added for perswasion, that they had <hi>seene his Starre.</hi> The Shepherds published the message of the Angells of the birth of the <hi>Messias.</hi> At twelve yeares of age he sat among the Doctors, hearing them and posing them. The holy Ghost in a bodily shape de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending on him at his Baptisme, and a voyce was heard from heaven, <hi>This is my beloved Sonne.</hi> Many hearers and beholders openly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, the one of his Words, that they never heard the like; the other of his Workes, that they never saw the like. Such Workes, such great Workes, that if <hi>Sidon</hi> had seene them, it would have beleeved; nay if
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:173124:116"/>
               <hi>Sodom</hi> had seene them, it would have beleeved. The heathen Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion, yea the fiends themselves confessed him. Yet their witts were so bewitched, that they could not understand; nay their hearts were so malitious, that they would not beleeve. Hee was daily in their eye, and yet they would not see: and who is so blinde, as hee that will not see? who having such helpes, such furtherances of Faith, in wilfull perversenesse would see, and not beleeve?</p>
            <p>This wilfull infidelitie bred their contempt of him; that they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced his person, depraved his actions, loded him with contumelies, and pursued him unto death, the cursed and shamefull death of the Crosse. They vilified his person by the basenesse of his parents, his kindred and profession. <hi>Is not this Iosephs Sonne? is not Mary his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and his brethren Iames and Ioses, Simon</hi> and <hi>Iude,</hi> and is hee not <hi>a Carpenter?</hi> They depraved his actions, both his doctrine, and his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles. His doctrine hereticall, as crossing <hi>Moses Law,</hi> and treasonous, he forbad <hi>to pay tribute unto Caesar.</hi> His miracles magicall; hee <hi>cast out Devils by the Prince of the Devils.</hi> Their tongues raild on him, <hi>a glutton, a wine bibber, a Samaritan, a Demoniack,</hi> and their hands delivered him to the secular power, to be handled of the Heathens with all indignitie, with all extremitie: They <hi>mockt him,</hi> they <hi>scourged him,</hi> they <hi>cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Forbids not our Saviour to <hi>cast pearles before swine,</hi> and <hi>to give holy things to dogges?</hi> Christs selfe is the pearle figured in the parable; God sent him to the Iewes; but they like swine betroad and betrampled him. Christ is <hi>the holy thing;</hi> the Angel calls him so, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 35. God gave him to the Iewes; but they like dogges turned on him, and rent him. Gods sending him, and giving him, was their seeing him. Their betrampling him, and rending him, was their not beleeving him. Such is the aversenesse of many sullen heart, that though God give him helpes to further him to Faith; yet he will not use them. Nay such is the perversenesse of mans malitious spirit, that though both the eye perceive without, and the wit conceive within; yet the heart shall <hi>ponere obicem;</hi> as God saith to the sea, <hi>Iob 28. hitherto thou shalt come, but goe no further,</hi> so the heart shall say to Christ, stand, thou commest no nearer me: that as the <hi>adder will not heare the charmer, charme he never so wisely;</hi> so let sense and understanding performe their function never so faithfully, yet the heart will cry, <hi>non credo,</hi> I beleeve not.</p>
            <p>To end this; they saw he was the Christ, but yet beleeved not. They saw it at his birth, and they saw it at his baptisme; they saw it in his life, and they saw it at his death. The miraculous eclipse, the splitting of the vaile, the trembling of the earth, the rending of the stones, the opening of the graves, and the rising of the dead, all these these their eyes did see; and yet they beleeved not. Yea his owne resurrection avouched even by those, whom themselves had set to watch about his sepulchre, their eyes did see that too: not onely a few women, who might haply bee deluded, not onely his Disciples, who might haply bee partiall, but hundreds of the people, five hundred at one time, had seene him with their eyes, and yet they beleeved not. Their eyes did their office, sense suggested to the heart;
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:173124:117"/> but heart, like a stiffe Recusant, would not hearken. <hi>Thomas</hi> is famous for his incredulitie, and is put into a proverbe, because he would see, before he would beleeve. What shall wee thinke of these for their infidelity, that though they saw, yet would not beleeve? The devills shall rise in judgement and condemne them; for they saw, and belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. For even the devills also have their faith, they confessed Christ, <hi>what have wee to doe with thee, Iesus thou Sonne of God? Credunt &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremiscunt,</hi> they beleeve though it be with trembling. Blame not the Gentile, who though hee heare of Christ, will not beleeve. Loe here the Iew, though hee doe looke on Christ, yet will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve.</p>
            <p>The third sort (if you please) shall be <hi>videntes &amp; credentes</hi> both see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and beleevers of the same age: with the second, but of more grace. Sight and Faith divor'cd in them, are met in these; <hi>sensus &amp; assensus,</hi> embreac't each other: what the eye beheld, the heart beleev'd, <hi>vidit &amp; arsit,</hi> the eye no sooner saw, but the heart was set on fire. The wise men of the East, <hi>Simeon,</hi> and <hi>Zacharie, Iohn Baptist</hi> and <hi>Nathaniel, Iairus</hi> and <hi>Zacchaeus,</hi> the two <hi>Iosephs,</hi> the Carpenter and the Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. <hi>Nicodemus</hi> and <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and the theefe upon the Crosse, the 11. Apostles, and the 70. Disciples. Of women, <hi>Mary</hi> the Virgin, and three other of her name, the woman with the Issue, <hi>Martha</hi> and <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi> and <hi>Anna</hi> the Prophetesse; Numbers of the Aliens, the two Roman Centurions, and many Samaritans, the woman at the well, and shee of <hi>Syrophoenicia:</hi> All these, and all other, whom his signes and Sermons converted to the Faith, <hi>viderunt &amp; crediderunt,</hi> both saw Christ, and beleeved.</p>
            <p>What shall I say of these? Christs blessing in my Text shall I deny it to this third sort, because it is there conferr'd upon the fourth? shall they say unto our Saviour, as <hi>Esau</hi> sayd to <hi>Isaac, hast thou but one bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, O my Father?</hi> Surely they are blessed, that see not, and beleeve: but they are nor blest alone. Those that beleeved and saw, were blest as well as these, though not so much as these. Christs meaning is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative. Christ approportions the blessing to the Faith. They saw and did beleeve; these see not and yet beleeve. Both sorts are blessed, but these more then they, because their faith is greater, then the others; of greater meede, because of greater merit: of greater merit, because by lesser meanes. I meane not merit in the Papists sense. I say then of this sort, that Christ hath blest them too. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> is an instance; <hi>Blessed art thou Bar-Ionah.</hi> Hee confessed Christ, but he had seene him first, Yea our Saviour saith in generall to all his Disciples, <hi>Matth. 13. blessed are your eyes, for you see mee.</hi> Blessed, not because they saw; for then <hi>Iudas</hi> had beene blessed; but because they beleeved whom they saw. It was a greater blessing to beare Christ, then to see Christ. And yet <hi>Mary</hi> was blessed (as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith) <hi>non tam concipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endo carnem Christi, quàm percipiendo fidem Christi;</hi> not so much for conceiving him within her wombe, as for receiving him within her heart.</p>
            <p>God in his wisedome, and his mercy both, had appointed this time for the comming of the <hi>Messias.</hi> 4000. yeares almost were past, since God
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:173124:117"/> first promist him. Christ said againe in <hi>Davids</hi> time, <hi>ecce venio, loe I come;</hi> and yet there passed 28. generations after that, before he came. Faith now through long differring begun to faint; and many, like the mockers in Saint <hi>Peters</hi> last Epistle, might haply aske, <hi>where is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of his comming?</hi> In tender compassion, both of that age, and all the ages since, which might have murmured more, God was then plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed for to send his Sonne; that whom their fathers had beleev'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seene, him now that age might see and beleeve: the sight of him, to confirme beleefe on him, both in them, and after ages; to feede faith in them, and to breede faith in us. Their faith enfeebled with long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, tired now with types, which were but shadowes; God saw it time to send them now the substance; that faith, like <hi>Moses</hi> hands, becomming heavie, sense, like <hi>Hur</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> might helpe to hold them up. For sight is faiths supporter. Which now so needed it, that even <hi>Nathaneel,</hi> whom Christ himselfe cald <hi>a true Israelite,</hi> yet would see Christ, ere hee confessed him. yea one of his Disciples, that had liv'd some yeares with him, was yet so incredulous of his resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, that sight would not suffice him: but as <hi>Isaac</hi> said to <hi>Iacob, sine tepalpem,</hi> so hee must feele and handle him; ere he will beleeve. Nay all his Disciples, though they saw him daily, yet were but shallow faithed. Else why calls he them faithlesse? and why saies hee to them all, <hi>O vos modicae fidei, O yee of little faith?</hi> Thus then was it needefull to confirme weake faith, not by sense onely, but the surest sense, the sense of sight. Multitudes beleeved, <hi>Ioan.</hi> 2. 23. but it was <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, they beheld, and saw. The men of <hi>Samaria</hi> in the fourth of S. <hi>Iohn</hi> said, they beleev'd on Christ, not for the womans saying, but because they heard and saw him their owne selves. <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> Christs harbinger, was faine to runne before him, and to point the people to him, ere they would beleeve. They had heard him preach of him; that was a good preparative, but that was not enough; he was faine with his finger to point them to his person, that they might see him too, <hi>Ecce agnus dei, Behold, &amp;c.</hi>

To <hi>Adam,</hi> to <hi>Abram,</hi> and so to all the Patriarkes he onely promist Christ; that sufficed them. To strengthen the promise, to after generations he added types. Againe to strengthen them, to their posteritie he sent the Prophets. And now to this age, whereof wee are now speaking, he sends his Sonne in person. He presents him to the Iewes not <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, in body, not in type; before onely object unto faith; but now also subject unto sense. And lest they might doubt of him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his godhead was masked with his humanity, the Deity lay hidden under his flesh; God gave them evidence also of it, eare-evidence, eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evidence.</p>
            <p>They heard and saw him powerfull both <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, both in word and workes; both <hi>oracula &amp; miracula,</hi> both his doctrine and his mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles begat beleefe; both argued Christ to bee more then a man. Of the one they said, <hi>never man spake like this man;</hi> of the other, <hi>nunquàm
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:173124:118"/> sic vidimus, wee never saw such things.</hi> They made the <hi>Samaritane</hi> wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man at the well, to aske in admiration, <hi>is not this the Messias!</hi> and the <hi>Roman</hi> Centurion at the Crosse, to cry, <hi>certainly this was the sonne of God.</hi> These two were Christs Apparitours to summon outward sense; <hi>oracula quasi auracula,</hi> to cite the eare, and <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

                  </gap>, miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi> be <hi>spectacula,</hi> to call the eye; so by hearing and beholding to learne to beleeve. Not that Faith is built on sense; a ground unsound for such a building; but that sense might worke the subject the fitter unto faith. Sense is not faiths founder, but it is faiths furtherer; it is the spirits usher to guide the heart to God. It is the Spirits messenger, to say un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the soule, as <hi>Philip</hi> to <hi>Nathaneel, veni &amp; vide;</hi> come and see thy selfe, and so much also, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The fourth and last sort, see not, and yet beleeve. [These our Saviour <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> calls here <hi>blessed.</hi> Those markes which Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> would see, ere hee beleeved, they beleeved, though they saw not.] So did the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarkes, and so doe now all Christians. <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> and all those early Patriarkes, <hi>Abram</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> and all those after fathers, and their generations even unto Christ, are of this ranke; but <hi>nos specialiter, Greg.</hi> Christians especially. For the Iewes though they saw not Christs selfe, they saw his types; and so they saw him in some sort. Christ saies it in the Gospel; <hi>Abram rejoyced to see my day, and saw it:</hi> But Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians have not seene either <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, either in person, or in type; and yet they have beleeved. These therefore our Saviour calls <hi>blessed</hi> in my Text.</p>
            <p>That faith is kindliest, that hath least helpes, that is wholy and soly grounded on the word. To flie unto the eye, Christ calls it <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, meere unbeleefe. <hi>Thomas</hi> is cald <hi>faithlesse,</hi> because hee will see, before he will beleeve. Sight is loves sense, not faiths sense. <hi>Faith comes by hearing,</hi> saith the Apostle, not by seeing, <hi>Aures</hi> be <hi>fores,</hi> the eares, the doores of faith. As preaching is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the dore of the word, <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 3. so hearing is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the doore of faith, <hi>Act.</hi> 14. 27. The mystery of godlinesse, <hi>i.</hi> our Saviour Christ, transcends the reach of reason: and shall sense seeke after it? His incarnation is beyond imagination: and will the eye perceive, what the wit cannot conceive? Neither <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> nor <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> can attaine to it. Faith disdaines conference with reason; much lesse indures it to consult with sense. <hi>Vides? non est Fides,</hi> saith <hi>Hugo de victore;</hi> and so saith the Apostle. <hi>Faith is of things non apparentium, of things that are not seene.</hi> I know Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> aimes it at another end; but the words sute well, and the sense is found here too.</p>
            <p>The eye of Faith excells the eye of Flesh. Heaven is not hid from it. Yea Gods most secret mysteries, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the most hidden things of God, faith discovers them. The Sunne which the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers call the heavens eye, sees not so farre, nor peirceth so sharply, as the eye of Faith. No creature can exclude it, no <hi>horizon</hi> can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine it. <hi>Steven</hi> saw the Sonne of man at the right hand of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Mans eye to descry Gods seat, it is impossible. But the Martyr being filled with the holy Ghost, Gods Spirit made Christ visible to his spirit.</p>
            <pb n="217" facs="tcp:173124:118"/>
            <p>Sound faith is neither suspicious, nor curious: it beleeves what God sayes, without sight, without examining. For since it is impossible for God to lye (for how should truth lye?) it is fit his word be credited for it selfe sake. It must not be examined with howes, and whies. That which the <hi>Psalmist</hi> saies of observing of the Law, that must the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian say of receiving of the Gospel, <hi>Psal. 119. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

                  </gap> I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputed not</hi> saith <hi>David;</hi> I argued <hi>not with God.</hi> The word is very elegant in the originall tongue, derived in the Hebrew from the pronoune <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> which signifieth, <hi>quid.</hi> Faith reasons not with God, it asketh no <hi>quids,</hi> no <hi>quarees,</hi> no <hi>quomodoes,</hi> no whats, no howes, no wherefores, it moveth no questions. It meekely yeelds assent, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly sayes <hi>Amen</hi> to every word of God.</p>
            <p>This is the faith, at which our Saviour wondred, in the Centurious storie. Wee seldome or never read of any thing, Christ wondred at, but faith. At it he did; both at the smallnesse of it in the <hi>Iewes, Mark.</hi> 6. 6. at the greatnesse of it in the Captaine. Christ sayd of it, and that with protestation, he had not found such faith, no not in Israel. The Christians faith is not inferiour. Christs word sufficed him, <hi>Dic verbum, &amp; sanabitur, say but the word, and my servant shall be whole.</hi> So doth it us. Gods onely word is warrant to our Faith. That word beares witnesse unto Christ, the written word to the begotten word; and in it wee heare of him; and hearing wee beleeve. And if Christ said to the woman, <hi>mulier magna est fides tua, woman great is thy Faith?</hi> I may better say to the Christian, <hi>homo, magna est fides tua,</hi> man, great is thy Faith. Shee saw him in person, on whom shee beleeved; wee onely heare of him, and yet have faith on him.</p>
            <p>I will not call it infidelitie; but surely tis great incredulity, to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to nothing but what eye beholds. If thou wilt beleeve nought, but what thou seest; <hi>cur non vis sepeliri,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> why go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est thou not quicke into thy Grave? for how knowest thou that thou livest? thou doest not see thy soule.</p>
            <p>To draw unto an end, Papists presse this Scripture to force on us their Transubstantiation. If wee will be blessed, wee must beleeve Christ present under the forme of Bread. Shall wee say he is not there, because wee see him not? <hi>Beati,</hi> saith our Saviour, <hi>qui non viderunt, &amp; tamen crediderunt, that have not seene, and yet beleeve.</hi> Idle impostors! will they make Christ meane all objects? Must I beleeve, whatsoever I see not, and therefore beleeve it, because I see it not? Saint <hi>Paul</hi> indeed teacheth us, Faith is of things unseene: not that all things must be belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that are unseene; but that they are unseene, that are belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Christ when he said to <hi>Thomas, because thou seest me, thou beleevest;</hi> meant not, that he saw that which he beleeved: but as Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> saith, <hi>aliud vidit, aliud credidit,</hi> sense saw but his humanity; but Faith confest his God-head, <hi>Dominus meus, &amp; Deus meus, my Lord, and my God.</hi> Christ meanes this Scripture meerely of himselfe: he calls them <hi>blessed,</hi> that have not seene him, and yet have beleeved. That is plaine, out of the former clause, <hi>Thomas, because thou hast seene me.</hi> These Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle eyes, that can see Christ in Bread, where he is not, cannot see him in
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:173124:119"/> the Scripture, where he is. Nor yet is faith groundlesse, because it is not founded on reason, and on sense. Faith hath a firmer foundation, then them both; and that is Gods word. Which ground when they bring for Transubstantiation, wee will beleeve Christ bodily present in the Sacrament, though wee see him not. That ground is the bounde that must confine our Faith. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Clem. Alex.</hi> knowledge relies on reason and on sense; but Faith is grounded onely on Gods word.</p>
            <p>To conclude, Christ, faiths blessed object hath here blessed faith; but sightlesse faith. It hath not seene Christ, but it shall. The reward (saith <hi>Augustine) credendi, quod non vides, est videre, quod credis:</hi> the reward of beleeving him, whom thou seest not, shall be to see him, whom thou beleevest: <hi>In whose fight,</hi> saith the <hi>Psalmist, is the fulnesse of joy.</hi> All faith is blessed, but this most, which hath least helpes. It hath <hi>eo plus meriti, quo minus argumenti;</hi> (a Papists saying, but wee may have a sober meaning) the lesse regard faith hath of earthly rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, the more reward it hath of heavenly glory. Vnto which hee bring us, who here blesseth us; <hi>cui, cum patre, &amp;c.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Text is <hi>Deus &amp; Rex, God</hi> and the <hi>King,</hi> our duty unto each; <hi>Feare</hi> to God, <hi>Honour</hi> to Kings, foure termes, disposed discreetly all; both the Persons, God before the King; and the duties, Feare to whom Feare, as <hi>Paul</hi> bids, tis laid to God; and <hi>Honour to whom Honour belongs,</hi> Its given the King: <hi>Peter</hi> followes <hi>Pauls</hi> rule, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, keepes exact order in all. If there be any doubt, tis in the duties. For <hi>Solomon</hi> bids, Feare the King as well was God. <hi>My Sonne, feare God and the King,</hi> and for Honour he bids too, <hi>Honora Dominum, Honour God.</hi> Indeed both duties are common to both Persons, both Feare and Honour due both to God and King; but not <hi>Ejusdem generis,</hi> the same Honour and Feare. Feare and Honour, Religious, both are Gods one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Civill Honour Kings claime; meaner persons, then Kings, Parents doe, the Priest does, aged persons doe, the Scripture bids it: All men doe; Saint <hi>Peter</hi> bids it in the beginning of this verse, <hi>Honour All Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the Persons, God to be the first, the King after, I thinke, no man will quarrell. Never was King so proud, as to grudge God the precedence. <hi>Solomon</hi> a King, marshals them so too, <hi>Feare God and the King.</hi> But heeres something amisse; some in the Popes behalfe, are not well pleased. <hi>Peter</hi> did well, to put God before the King: but did he well, to set the King next after God? was there not another Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:173124:120"/> to have beene put betweene? Ancient <hi>Ignatius</hi> put the Bishop next to God, and the King <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, after him. <hi>Tertuallian</hi> cals the King, <hi>Hominem Deo secundum,</hi> a man, but next to God. But <hi>Ignatius</hi> was so bold, as to crowd in one betweene, as if Bishops were Kings betters, Miters above Crownes. The Bishop of Romes Chaplaines for the Popes preeminence, make <hi>Ignatius</hi> to say so. They foist into the Fathers, what they please. Father <hi>Ignatius Loiola</hi> would have been a fitter Father for such a bastard Child. Enough of the disposition of the words, heare the Exposition of the sense.</p>
            <p>This dayes Festivity is in honour of the King. Thats in my Text the latter Lesson. The former is Gods feare, a fit introduction to Kings honour: the fearers of God honour the King most. But the latter Theme is large; and <hi>Opus Diei,</hi> would be done <hi>In Die suo,</hi> I shall treate but of it onely. All Honour is Gods right <hi>Primarily.</hi> But as <hi>Bonum</hi> is <hi>Sui Communicativum,</hi> so God of his goodnesse imparts it unto men. But <hi>Maxime, &amp; Proxime,</hi> next to himselfe, and most to Kings. For they are next to God, <hi>Homines Deo secundi,</hi> you heard out of <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian.</hi> Kings must be honoured; but how? The Apostle tels but <hi>Quod;</hi> the Preacher must show <hi>Quomodo.</hi> Foure kinds of honour doe pertaine to Kings, Reverence, Obedience, Fidelity, and Aide.</p>
            <p>Their Reverence is threefold, <hi>Mentis, Oris, Corporis,</hi> Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> (I thinke) saith. I am sure, he saith, Subjects must <hi>Sentire Sublimiter,</hi> have an high esteeme of Princes states; hold them <hi>Solo Deo minores,</hi> None above them, but God. Christians held <hi>Caesar</hi> so, <hi>Tertullian</hi> saith, <hi>Moses</hi> cals them gods, <hi>Exod. 22. Diis non detrahes.</hi> Gods selfe does, <hi>Ego dixi, I said ye are gods.</hi> God and <hi>Moses</hi> both, for their superemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent power, supreame next under God. <hi>Iesuites</hi> say, no; they claime supremacy for the Pope, Kings are their Vassals, Emperours are, must hold their stirrop, lead their horse. Not Kings now, Popes are gods. <hi>Dominus Deus noster Papa,</hi> Our Lord God the Pope, saith the glosse in the <hi>Canon</hi> law.</p>
            <p>Sixe hundred yeares after Christ it was not so. Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> cald the Emperour his Lord. <hi>Ahimelecke</hi> the high Priest cald himselfe <hi>Sauls</hi> servant. <hi>David</hi> cald <hi>Zadoc</hi> his servant. Yea <hi>Aaron</hi> the most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable of all high Priests cals <hi>Moses</hi> his Lord. The Pope is not, nor (I thinke) will say, he is, a higher Person in the Church, then <hi>Aaron</hi> was. He was <hi>Pontifex maximus.</hi> The Pope cannot be more. Nothing is <hi>Majus Maximo.</hi> I must here pray the Popes pardon; haply I tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe him. He is <hi>Aarons</hi> Superiour; <hi>Romes</hi> high Priest above <hi>Israels.</hi> For he is Christs Vicar. That title ancient Fathers made common to all chiefe Bishops, proper to the Pope none did before Saint <hi>Bernard.</hi> But are not Kings <hi>Vacarii Dei,</hi> Gods Vicars, his leivetenants too? Their Angelicall Doctor, <hi>Aquinas</hi> cals them so. <hi>Bernard</hi> did before him; Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> before him. A Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> before him. <hi>Eleutherius</hi> wrote to <hi>Lucius</hi> a Brittaine King, <hi>Vos estis Dei Vicarius,</hi> You are Gods Vicegerent in your Kingdome. And not he onely; two other Popes have cald two Emperours so. The Lawes call Kings Lords paramont; no power peere to the Kings.</p>
            <p>Doth God, Scriptures, and Fathers, some Romanists too, no great
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:173124:120"/> friends to kings, give such titles unto Princes? How unreverently then doe some esteeme of them, that envie them the ordinary termes of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galitie, Grace, Highnesse, and Majestie? Called by a disloyall Scot, Court-<hi>Soloecismes</hi> and <hi>Barbarismes;</hi> and that writing to a King. What would he say to sacred Majestie, which was used to Queene <hi>Elizabeth?</hi> What to the stile of antient Emperours, <hi>Numen nostrum, nostra Peren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitas, Aeternitas?</hi> Supreme Head under Christ, in the King of <hi>Englands</hi> Stile, is censured by some Novellists. Be Papists pardoned for the Popes sake: they thinke, tis wrong to him. But for Protestants to find fault with honour done to Kings, what is it but to disclaime their Religion. Enough of mentall Reverence. Let every sober spirit thinke of the King at least, as of the Lords annointed. Scriptures warrant that.</p>
            <p>The tongues reverence is next. The heart may happly vilipend the King; thought is free, feares no informer. But let the mouth beware, the walls have eares. <hi>Salomon</hi> curbes even the thought too, bids, not venture so farre, lest that which have wings bewray it. The mouth to dishonour the King, God forbids, <hi>Thou shalt not revile the Ruler of the people. Paul</hi> did but the high Priest, <hi>Caesars</hi> farre inferiour: but hee was soone checkt, and pleaded, <hi>Non putâram. Elihu</hi> askes in <hi>Iob,</hi> will one say to a King, thou art wicked? Yet <hi>Shemei</hi> did to <hi>David, Come forth, come forth, thou wicked man:</hi> rested not so in the generall, said more, thou art a murtherer, said it twise; did more yet, curst him too, curst him (<hi>David</hi> saith) with an horrible curse, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the <hi>Rabbins</hi> note a reproach in every letter. A subject to raile on his Soveraigne is unchristian. Yet Romanists and Separatists do it both. French Kings by the one, King <hi>Iames</hi> and Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> by both, what base reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches they have borne, becomes me not to speake out. It is a <hi>Canon</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolicall, that the reproacher of a King be, if a Clergie man, depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, if a lay-man, excommunicate. Speake evill of no man, <hi>Paul</hi> bids; then much lesse of Kings. But be sure thou curse them not. Pray for them, though they be impious; even for <hi>Nebuchodonoser</hi> and <hi>Balthasar</hi> his sonne, <hi>Baruch</hi> bids: thats <hi>Apocrypha: Paul</hi> bad, pray for Kings, when as yet all Kings were Heathen; yea when <hi>Nero</hi> reigned, both a Gentile and a persecutor.</p>
            <p>The bodies reverence remaines. It bowes to every better, bends the knee to a meane Magistrate. It falls downe to regall Majestie, on the knee at least on the face to Kings in Scripture. <hi>Ahimaaz</hi> did to <hi>David, David</hi> did to <hi>Saul,</hi> even the Kings sonne did to his father, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.</p>
            <p>The second kind of honour was obedience: thats reall honour [meant by <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>ver. 13. Subject your selves:</hi> Subjection is obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. <hi>Paul</hi> therefore couples them, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 1.] and in the Greeke tongue, Subjects are called <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Obeyers, the very name of Subject meanes Obedience. Masters and Parents will crave this, every Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate will; much more Kings. [Disobeyers of them, some Councils excommunicate] Is not their power from God? <hi>Paul</hi> saith it; and that them to disobey, is to resist him. <hi>Peter</hi> here therefore puts Princes honour next to Gods feare. They being Gods Vicegerents, the Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pisers
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:173124:121"/> of them will not greatly dread him. He that will say with the sonnes of <hi>Belial, Who is Saul that we should serve him?</hi> Will aske also with the Atheists, <hi>Iob 26. Who is the Almighty, that we should serve him? Donatists</hi> did sometime, Libertines doe now plead Christian libertie. It frees them from this bondage of obeying Kings. It was sinne, that brought in servitude. Idle men▪ Kings crave not bondage, but inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous subjection; not servitude, but obedience. It stands with Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian libertie. Christs selfe was <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, subject to his Parents, and obeyed them.</p>
            <p>Lawes (I thinke no man will doubt) must be obeyed: they are the bonds of civill life, the life of common wealths. What is the King lightly, but a living law? And therefore one couples them, <hi>Regi &amp; Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi,</hi> obey Princes and Lawes. Some disobeying both in the cause of Religion, gave occasion unto <hi>Porphyrie</hi> and <hi>Iulian</hi> the <hi>Apostata,</hi> to slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Christianitie, as an enemy to governement, and the publike weale of Kingdomes. The Centurion told Christ, if he bad his souldier, come, he came; if goe, he went: if he bad his servant, doe this, or that, hee did it, and shall a Kings Command private or publike be slighted by his subject? His wrath (saith <hi>Solomon</hi>) is like a Lyons roare, a messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of death. Feare is a forcing argument; I had rather use a fairer. Obey for conscience sake, <hi>Et propter Dominum,</hi> for Gods cause, <hi>Peter</hi> bids <hi>ver.</hi> 13. and obey cheerefully. <hi>Iustin</hi> writes, Christians did, <hi>Inser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vire laeti,</hi> obeyed <hi>Antoninus</hi> gladly, though a bad Emperour.</p>
            <p>Two scruples here doe pray a little leave. This Office of obedience, first lies it on all persons? Then, is it in all things? The first I must affirme; <hi>Paul</hi> warrants me. Though <hi>Peters</hi> precept have no note; yet it is universall. <hi>Paul</hi> is his <hi>Paraphrast, Omnis anima, Let every soule be subject;</hi> all men must obey. The Pope saith, nay; Priests must not, Church-men are exempt. For they are not the Kings, but the Bishop of Romes subjects: so saith <hi>Emanuel Sa,</hi> a <hi>Iesuite,</hi> No Clergie mans cause belongs to the cognition of a secular Iudge. Theres indeed such a caveat in the Canon law, <hi>Nullus praesumat, &amp;c.</hi> Let no man dare convent any of the Clergie before a civill Magistrate. But that Chapter is bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with a <hi>Palea,</hi> tis but chaffe. Cried not <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that hee ought to be tried <hi>

                  </gap>
               </hi> grants him bound to the Kings politicall lawes. But the obligation is directive, not <hi>Coactive;</hi> except the Church have first approved of them. As for <hi>Pauls Omnis anima, every soule,</hi> thats (say they) every lay soule. But Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> crosses that, extends it unto Churchmen too <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, whether thou be a Prophet, an Apostle, or Evangelist. <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> confesses it, <hi>Includit etiam Clericos,</hi> it includes the Clergie too. If he did not, <hi>Bernard</hi> doth, a Father, but a Romanist, saith, writing to an Archbishop, If every soule be subject, then is thine, <hi>Quis vos exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit ex universitate,</hi> who hath exempted thee out of the generalitie? I say then, Persons Ecclesiasticall, not Civill onely, owe obedience unto Kings, Supreame governours over both.</p>
            <p>The other scruple was, Whether in all things. I may not affirme that; else should a King be, not next to God, but Peere to him. Nay Gods superiour. For Princes sometimes bid, what God forbids. In
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:173124:121"/> that case, our Apostle bids, obey God rather; All the Apostles doe, <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 29. Princes must be obeyed, but, <hi>Intra limites disciplinae, Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian,</hi> within the bounds of Religion. If their precept shall passe that; then <hi>Peters</hi> rule, must overrule, <hi>Deo magis, quàm Hominibus. Paul</hi> enjoyned obedience to <hi>Omnis Anima,</hi> but not <hi>In Rebus Omnibus,</hi> to every Soule, but not in every thing. Tis in our Kings just style, not onely over all persons, but in all causes too. Thats in the kind of cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, not in the quality, <hi>i.</hi> in spirituall as well as temporall, not in bad, as well as good. King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, when hee made Sir <hi>Thomas Moore,</hi> Lord Chancellour, bad him looke first at God, and then at Him. <hi>Theophylacts</hi> distinction is unsound, a Father, but not antient, Obey Kings <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, God <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; Kings commanding in both, must be obeyed; so they countermand not God.</p>
            <p>To end this; theres a <hi>Quatenus</hi> in both, as not in spirituall causes, so not in temporall too, must Princes be obeyed, opposing God. As if commanding in the one, impiety, I must refuse: so, if they charge me in the other, to act any iniquity, I must not Obey. Neither would <hi>Sidrac</hi> and his fellows commit idolatry, nor the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Midwives murther, though the King commanded. And both their disobedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces God approved; for he rewarded them. <hi>Saul</hi> bad <hi>Ionathan</hi> kill <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid;</hi> he would not. Else obey readily and willingly. It is one Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a naughty nature, to be refractary. <hi>Facile est imperium in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos. Plaut.</hi> We call our Kings, Leige Lords: and what is Allegiance, but the bond of Obedience. Which where Subjects deny; theres con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion, worse, destruction, <hi>Pessum Omnia,</hi> all goes to wracke.</p>
            <p>The third kind of honour is Fidelity, I will not say, it is above O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience; but the breach of it is above Disobedience? Rebellion the grandest dishonour to a King. There is <hi>Laesa maiestas,</hi> the King is wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, if but vilipended in thy thought; more if vilified too in speech; more yet, if disobeyed. But if forcibly opposed, oppugnd by Armes; that sinne is superlative, out of measure sinfull. Kings bind the heart sometimes, the Oath does of Supremacy, ties even the Conscience in that case. The King will not be wronged, no not in thought. The Trespassour is a Traytor, even in that. What a Treason is it then, to take armes against the King, or any way to plot, to touch his Crowne, or Person? I will not cite the <hi>Psalme, Touch not mine Annointed;</hi> that speakes not to this point. But <hi>Davids Absit</hi> showes how hainous that Act is, <hi>God forbid, I should lay mine hand on Gods Annointed.</hi> Yea, his heart smote him, that he had cut off but the lap of <hi>Sauls</hi> garment. Gods judgement on such sinners see in Scripture. <hi>Achitophel</hi> hung himselfe; <hi>Absalon</hi> perisht too. <hi>Augustus</hi> hated the betrayer of his enemy, <hi>Amo Proditionem, odi Proditorem.</hi> Treason <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the greatest crime among the <hi>Romanes,</hi> saith a Greeke historian. In punishing it, <hi>Tullie</hi> saith, no Iudge can be too cruell. The traitor, a devill; Christ cald <hi>Iudas</hi> so.</p>
            <p>How abominable then is not the practise onely, but the doctrine too of some Romanists, to Act, and maintaine Treason? <hi>Sanders</hi> is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what moderate, saith an Hereticall King is not to be obeyed. He may be so without Rebellion, Recusants disobey, but take not Armes. An
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:173124:122"/> other, hotter then he, bids, depose him. Others exceed that too, [and those not onely of the old learning, Papists, but of the new Discipline, Schismatickes] bid, kill the King; kill him, if a Tyrant. <hi>Quacunque arte,</hi> it is lawfull any way, saith <hi>Mariana.</hi> The Piamitive Church was not taught this Divinitie; they rose not against <hi>Caesars,</hi> though nere so bloudy persecutors. Must masters, notwithstanding their curstnesse, be obeyed, <hi>ver. prox.</hi> And must Princes be oppugned, if too sharpe? Leud <hi>Loyolite</hi> lay not thy hand on Gods anointed, though he be a Tyrant, yet he is thy King. Even when <hi>Peter</hi> wrote this precept, a most wicked Tyrant raign'd, a ravisher of his sisters, and a slayer of his Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. Thou must obey as well <hi>Nero,</hi> as <hi>Augustus;</hi> as well <hi>Domitian,</hi> as <hi>Vespatian, Iulian,</hi> as <hi>Constantine.</hi> Their tyrannie loosens not the bond of thine Allegiance. The takers of the Oath of it, sweare they heartily abhorre the <hi>Iesuites,</hi> authorising the killing of a King. That they call a wicked oath. But the Kings of <hi>spaine,</hi> the Liege Lord of all <hi>Iesuites</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised the very like in their Councils of <hi>Toledo,</hi> many hundreds of yeares since.</p>
            <p>Papists say, we slander them, they teach not to kill Kings. Doth not <hi>Bellarmine</hi> maintaine Rebellion to be lawfull, <hi>In crimine gravissimo;</hi> if a King commit some grievous crime? Why rose not <hi>Israel</hi> against <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> in the cause of <hi>Vrias?</hi> Why not against <hi>Salomon</hi> in a worse cause, Idolatrie? Why not against <hi>Saul,</hi> not a murthering onely, but a massa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cring King. An hereticall King (<hi>Sanders</hi> saith) is no King. He <hi>ipso facto</hi> is <hi>Excommunicatus;</hi> and excommunication dissolves all civill bonds, allegiance and all, they say, the Canonists hold. Did they, it skild not, Popes parasites most of them: but they doe not. They except divers bonds, <hi>Vtile, lex, humile, &amp;c.</hi> And this rule is in their Law, <hi>Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catio Domini non liber at vasallum a Sacramento;</hi> No vassall is freed from his service, though his Lord be excommunicate. <hi>Henry Burbon</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> King <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> the one was crowned, the other obeyed, though both under the Popes curse. But seeing there are Romanists hold this, why offer we the oath of Allegiance to such kind of Papists? It is <hi>Ipso facto</hi> void: the King is not a whit the securer by his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it.</p>
            <p>To end this; Religion and Rebellion do not sute. <hi>Nunquàm Cassiani in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venti sunt Christiani,</hi> Never was true Christian, traitor to his King. It is a <hi>Proverbe</hi> in <hi>Guicciardin,</hi> that it is the Churches propertie to hate their <hi>Caesars.</hi> It must meane the Romish Church. A Clergie man, a Romane Catholique, rebelling, is no traitor, <hi>Emmanuel Saes Essay. Iesuites</hi> are contrivers of treason in all lands. Popish Churchmen are King-quel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours; [Who kild King <hi>Iohn?</hi>] But as an honourable Knight saith in his Observations, Never any Protestant of the Clergie in this land, had hand in any treason.</p>
            <p>The last honour is Tribute, a queasie theme, but yet most necessary in these times to be prest. Tribute no gracious word in the prime sense, an involuntarie taxe, laid on a forrain people, cōquered by the sword. Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects so are not wont to be tributaries. But by tributes, I mean peaceable Imposts, and free Sesses, be it Custome, or Subsidie, or whatsoever else due even to gracious Kings, either to sustaine their States, or support
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:173124:122"/> the publike charges of the Common-wealth. Good subjects neede not be tributaries; but they are contributaries; and the taxes, not forced exactions, but ingenuous grants. Bids <hi>Salomon honour God, De substantia tua, with a part of thy estate?</hi> God needs it not; yet he craves it, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise thy obedience. Honour the King with it, besides thy obedience he needs it. Gods Word awardes it him. If not that in <hi>Samuel, Hoc erit, jus Regis:</hi> Yet that in <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 13. 7. If not <hi>Samuels Tollet,</hi> hee shall take, yet <hi>Pauls Redite,</hi> you shall give: Give, what? <hi>Tribute</hi> and <hi>Custome,</hi> both there expresly. Give, how?

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Argument of my Text, is a sight, a strange sight, <hi>spectaculum, miraculum,</hi> a sight of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as it followeth in this verse, <hi>I wondred when I saw her.</hi> To see a woman, is no wonder. And yet if the Pope be meant by this spectacle; it is a wonder to see a woman Pope: a thing never seene but once; the Papists say, not once. But to see a woman drunke: that is a strange sight; a bloody woman, a strange sight. A drunken man is no rare sight; we see them daily [in our streets; <hi>Video &amp; taceo,</hi> we see them daily, and say nothing. The Boyes perchance will wonder at them; but <hi>Sapiens nihil admiratur;</hi> magistrates, that are, or should be wise, rather winke, then wonder at them.] A bloody man is no rare thing neither, oftner seene, then sentenced; [at least wise, as the law requires.] Gods law, and the Kings? But a drunken woman is a strange sight. You finde not in all the Scripture, a woman taken drunke; one is mistaken, 1 <hi>Sam. Heli</hi> thought <hi>Hannah</hi> drunke, but she was not. [More shame for men, to be so common in that vice; and yet the woman the weaker vessell too.] And a bloody woman is a strange sight. <hi>Vir sanguinum, a man of blood,</hi> we read it often: but a woman of blood never. But a woman to drinke blood, to drinke mans blood, <hi>sanguinem innocuum, i.</hi> guiltlesse blood; to drinke much blood, even till she be drunken; that sight strange indeed, worthy to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred at. Such a sight is here, <hi>id est,</hi> such a sight of such a woman;
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:173124:123"/>
               <hi>Iohn</hi> saw <hi>a woman drunken with the blood of Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Text containes an Object, and an Act: the Act, seeing, the seer, Saint <hi>Iohn, I saw.</hi> The Object, <hi>a Woman;</hi> her case, <hi>drunken;</hi> with what? <hi>with blood;</hi> whose blood? <hi>of Saints. I saw a woman drunken with the blood of Saints.</hi> These are the points; they many, the time short; and I would speake of all. By Gods grace, and your patience, briefely of each in order.</p>
            <p>The Copulative note would not be neglected neither: for is there the least particle idle in the Scripture? Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> saw a woman moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and yet the woman drunke. They sit unsafely, that are drunke, on horse backe, But this woman is mounted on the devils backe; he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver casts his rider, but in hell. Shee cannot fall; she were happy, if she did. Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> saw a woman, which made others drunke; and now he sees her drunke her selfe. They lightly that egg others to drinke more then is fit, know their owne bodies better able to beare drinke, and yet the foxe is caught sometimes. So is this woman, shee hath begunne so long to others, that shee is gone her selfe. By sipping of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten she hath supt so much; that now shee is drunke also. Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> saw a woman made others drunke with wine; and now he sees her selfe drunke with blood. [They too were drunke with blood, the blood of grapes; but shee is drunke with blood, the blood of men.]</p>
            <p>Now to come to the Seer; <hi>I saw.</hi> I should not presse the person, because it is supprest: the Greeke hath it not. It hath it not, because it needs it not: for it was before. But to you, it is new, and therefore needs. For Prophecy stands much on the authority of the Person. Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians often hide their names; for they skill not. Looke on the foure Evangelists, and almost all the bookes of story in the Bible; it is rare to finde in them, who wrote them. But survey the Prophets all of them; not one of them conceales his name. The Author of this booke wrote a Gospell too; you shall not finde his name in that; but in this it is five times. The same man, when he writes as an Evangelist, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses it; but when as a Prophet, he expresses it. Now then though the Originall expresse not the person, nor the English the name; but the words be onely, <hi>And I saw:</hi> yet just occasion offers here the Question, who is that <hi>I?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Author himselfe answers it in the beginning of the booke, <hi>Ego Iohannes,</hi> the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, is <hi>Iohn.</hi> But now the question is more busie, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; who is that <hi>Iohn?</hi> For beside <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Marke,</hi> of which two there is no question, we find of this name, an Apostle, an Evangelist, and <hi>Iohn</hi> the elder, and <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Divine.</hi> Hence have some doubted who should write this booke; and hence might we doubt too, who should see this vision. But it is a doubt in seeming, not in deed; not worth dispute: For all the foure are one. Diverse causes, cast on him diverse titles; but the man is the same: one of the twelve, that kept with Christ, and so cald an Apostle: one of the foure, that wrote of Christ, and so also an Evangelist: the <hi>Elder</hi> for his age, or his dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in the Church: and the <hi>Divine,</hi> for the high beginning of his Gospell with the Deity of Christ. <hi>Iohn,</hi> an Apostle, a chiefe Apostle: more; <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> phraseth it, more then a chiefe Apostle;
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:173124:124"/> Christs Cozen german: deare unto him, <hi>the Disciple</hi> whom the Lord <hi>loved:</hi> neere unto him, <hi>for he leaned on his brest.</hi> Nay an Apostle, an Evangelist, and a Prophet too; and so was never any, <hi>Luke</hi> an Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist, but no Apostle. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> an Apostle, but no Evangelist. Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> both, but no Prophet. Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> all three. To him the Lord vouchsaft this vision, <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iames,</hi> Christ cald as well as <hi>Iohn,</hi> to see his <hi>Transfiguration:</hi> but hee held <hi>Iohn</hi> onely worthy to heare his <hi>Revelation.</hi> I haste from the Person to the Act, He <hi>saw.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Prophets anciently were called Seers. Not of the Eye; all men see so; but they saw in the Spirit. So did Saint <hi>Iohn chap. 1. ver. 10. Visio</hi> in Philosophy is the Act of sense; but in Theology it is taken more Divinely. The Eye sees naturally: but in Divinity, as <hi>Plato</hi> said, <hi>Mens videt,</hi> it is the Minde. The body sees by sense, waking, by the Eye; sleeping, by the phantasie. But Visions in Divinity are in the spirit, and by the spirit; in the spirit of man, by the Spirit of God. The bodies sight is of things present onely, present in time, present in place. But the spirits is of things farre off: farre off for place; Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> sees in <hi>Patmos</hi> things done in <hi>Rome:</hi> and farre off for time; he saw before, what should be done long after. Visions are previsions. Seer, what seest thou?</p>
            <p>No warrant for the brainsicke visions of schismaticks, papists, and familists, which all bragge of Revelations: all of them either ecstati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call passions, or sathanicall illusions: ecstaticall, and so not prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, but phantacies, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Basil.</hi> sathanicall, and so not Revelations, but delusions. I may not stay here neither. Not the seer, but the sight; not that he saw, but what he saw: the subject of the Vision, is the project of my speech principally: I come to it. <hi>Iohn saw a woman.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To see a Woman is not strange; except the woman her selfe be strange. The Scripture calls a harlot a strange woman. This Woman my Text cals her not a harlot; but it meanes her one, by saying shee was drunken. Whom <hi>Bacchus bathes,</hi> washes, <hi>Venus</hi> lightly <hi>warmes,</hi> dries. A drunken man, I will doubt, he is not honest; but a drunken woman without doubt is naught. And so is this. In the first <hi>verse</hi> of this <hi>chapter</hi> shee is called the <hi>Great Whore.</hi> A woman no strange sight; but Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> saith, he saw <hi>the woman,</hi> that is, a whore, a great whore. I pray you pardon me this odious terme, as harsh to my tongue, as to your eares. I wonder not, Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> wondred at the sight: you know, such women are the peoples wonderment: the maidens gaze at them, the young men point, and hisse, and whoope at them. But the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man here more worthy of wonderment. I will not presse her cloathing, purple and scarlet, gold, pearle, and pretious stones. Surely, Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> would not have wondred at that, had he seene the pompe of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men now. But a <hi>woman</hi> mounted on <hi>a Beast</hi> of wonder, <hi>scarled coloured,</hi> with <hi>seaven heads,</hi> and <hi>tenne hornes;</hi> A <hi>name</hi> of wonder <hi>in her forehead, Great Babylon;</hi> A <hi>Cup</hi> of wonder in her hand: the metall of such worth, but the liquor of such filth, that the holy Evangelist, as one sicke at the sight, could not say, what he saw, without <hi>Soloecisme</hi> of speech. The Greeke hath such grammar, as you shall not often finde.</p>
            <pb n="229" facs="tcp:173124:124"/>
            <p>The woman is described by three unlovely qualities, unsatiable, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifull, unjust. She drinkes, till she be <hi>drunken:</hi> her drinke is <hi>bloud,</hi> the bloud is the Saints. Of the second first; order craves it; <hi>Quid</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Quantum,</hi> Her drinke is <hi>bloud. Iohn</hi> sees a woman drunken, not <hi>flumine,</hi> but <hi>sanguine,</hi> not with water, but with bloud: not the bloud of grapes, as wine is call'd in Scripture, but the bloud of men: as God saith of the <hi>Iewes</hi> in <hi>Esay, They are drunke, but not with wine.</hi> Belike she remembred that she was a <hi>Roman;</hi> and therefore durst not venture to drinke wine; which for a woman to doe in <hi>Rome,</hi> was death. She is a thirst, and there is no heart in water; and therefore she drinkes bloud.</p>
            <p>If she may not be <hi>Vinolenta;</hi> she will be <hi>Sanguinolenta;</hi> if she may not drinke the bloud of grapes, she will drinke the bloud of men. A drinke beseeming better the Beast on which she rode. Wild beasts delight in it; but the heart of man abhorres it. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, saith Saint <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> the savadge <hi>Scythian</hi> will not doe it. Hee will pricke his horse, and drinke his bloud: but mans bloud to be mans drinke, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver read save among <hi>Cannibals.</hi> Certainly this woman, like unto the <hi>Centaures,</hi> rides not on this Beast, but is one bodie with the Beast. The Beast drinkes bloud; It is Sathan, say the Fathers; Christ saith, he is a <hi>Murtherer from the beginning.</hi> Her diet is like his, as her colour is like his; her garment <hi>scarlet</hi> like his skinne. Both betoken bloud. It beto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens bloud, as it is but onely red; but that it is scarlet; the depth of the die argues delight in bloud, her glory in it. A woman bloudy-coted, and bloudie-hearted, like to <hi>Herods</hi> wife; of whom Saint <hi>Basil</hi> saith <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, her meat was slaughter, and her drinke was bloud.</p>
            <p>The Papacie the Antitype of this drunken woman, as it was first bred of bloud, so it ever fed of bloud. It breathed first by murther; and it breathes murthers still. Where ever set the Pope his foot, but the ground forthwith grew thirstie of bloud? Let no man wrangle at the Metaphor; it is here an Angels, and a frequent phrase in Scripture. Popes drinke not bloud in proper meaning; but their drinking it, is their shedding it, and their thirsting after bloud, is their lusting after it. Looke, who would not submit to that Sea, his paine must be, not <hi>fasces,</hi> but <hi>secures,</hi> not stripes, not fine, not banishment, but death. Hee will crie against him, as the people did at Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with him from the earth.</hi> Say he were an Hereticke, yet the Pope should crie not <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, but <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> purge the man, not kill the man; purge him by reason, not by prison; purge away his heresie, not purge away his life. But the Pope is all peremptorie, his crie is <hi>Crucifige.</hi> A staffe will not serve <hi>Balaam; Vtinam mihi gladius esset,</hi> he wishes he had a sword to kill. The Popes Episcopall staffe, <hi>i.</hi> his curse contents him not; it must be a sword, a weapon of bloud.</p>
            <p>Christ gave Saint <hi>Peter</hi> keyes; but they are blunt: what should the Pope doe with them? Were hee not very patient, hee would throw them into <hi>Tiber.</hi> Saint <hi>Peter</hi> had a sword; and the Pope thinkes hee should too. Nay hee thinkes his finger stronger than Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Ioines; he had but one sword, he hath two. He smote off but an eare with his; he smites off heads with his.</p>
            <p>But to end this point, I would the Pope had but this one fault, cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:173124:125"/> to spill bloud: but shee hath an another worse than this, that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes this, it is iniquitie; shee spills guiltlesse bloud. It is <hi>the bloud of Saints,</hi> the next point in my Text.</p>
            <p>There are sundry sorts of blouds, as there are of wines. The woman is wanton; common bloud contents her not; the unholy harlot must have holy bloud.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>David</hi> said, <hi>Right precious in the sight of the Lord, is the death of his Saints.</hi> But I may say, delitious in the taste of the beast, is the bloud of the Saints. The holier the bloud, the freel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er the draught. Tis not the bloud of Innocents, but the bloud of Saints. It is great injustice to slaughter the guiltlesse, though he be an Infidell. Death is for delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents; and not for all them neither. <hi>Peccata</hi> be not <hi>paria;</hi> offences are not all of equall hainousnesnesse. Death is for dangerous and desperate malefactors. Except the crime be, why should the paine capitall? But to afflict the just, to inflict the paine of death upon the guiltlesse, is grand wickednesse. But it is here not onely <hi>Iustorum,</hi> but <hi>Sanctorum,</hi> the bloud not of the righteous, but of Saints, of holy men. One may be just, and yet not holy; no breaker of the Law, and yet no truster in the Gospell; a Sadducee, and yet no Saint. Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> saith the Sadducees, and so saith <hi>Epiphanius</hi> to, that they had their name of righteousnesse; but they were but sorrie Saints; for they denied the Resurrection. [And <hi>many</hi> a man is put away through the errour of the Iudge, that is cleare of the crime, he suffers for, a just man touching it.] But a Saint, a holy man, a worshipper of God, to shed his bloud, is hainous homicide, horrible parricide. Such bloud sheds this woman, this whorish drunken woman suckes and suppes such bloud, the bloud of Saints; and that in such abundance, that she is drunke with it, the last point in my Text.</p>
            <p>Not wine drunke, but bloud drunke: not <hi>de fruge,</hi> but <hi>de strage,</hi> not of barley, but of bloud. That more pardonable, as of weakenesse, this abominable, of set wickednesse. The Church, the child of Peace to thirst for bloud; no bloud to serve her, but the Saints; to drinke so long of it, so much of it, that shee is drunken? It is not a finger onely dipt in bloud, to touch her tongue, will serve: (<hi>Dives</hi> in hell desir'd but that, and that of water;) but shee must have her full draught of it, many draughts.</p>
            <p>Not of wine, much lesse of bloud, will one draught make one drunke. The Vine (saith <hi>Pythag.</hi>) hath three grapes, the first of Thirst, the next of Pleasure, the third of Drunkennesse. But her draughts of bloud are many; not dozens, as our Drunkards use, but hundreds, many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds, thousands, many thousands; it is no marvell, if shee be drunke with them: like <hi>Syllaes</hi> in <hi>Plutarke,</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, no tale of them, no end of them. <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, the <hi>Horse-leech hath two daughters,</hi> which are ever crying, <hi>give, give.</hi> Surely I thinke this woman is one of them. Why doe I wrong her? Shee is not <hi>Sanguisuga,</hi> but <hi>Sanguibiba,</hi> shee suckes not bloud, but she drinkes it. Nor doth she, like the <hi>Horse-leech,</hi> fall off when she is full; but like the drunken, drinke she never so much, yet she is drie still, and thirstie for more. The dogges of <hi>Nilus lambunt, non bibunt,</hi> for feare of the <hi>Crocodiles,</hi> they lap a little, and away. But his bloud-bibber, she sippes not lightly, but shee suppes it up, shee em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brues
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:173124:125"/> her hands with it, she bathes her selfe in it.</p>
            <p>The Romanists would faine divert our eyes from the Pope to the bloud-shead by Emperours; which indeed was much; but they were Infidells. The Pope, Christs Vicar; and yet his bloudshed more. <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina</hi> writes of 17000. martyred by <hi>Dioclesian:</hi> but <hi>Metarane</hi> writes of 50000. slaughtered by the Pope, onely in the low countries, onely in <hi>Charles</hi> time the fifth. <hi>Natalis Comes</hi> of 60000. in <hi>France</hi> onely in one yeare. <hi>Iulius</hi> the second, in seven yeares shed the bloud of above 200000. Christians. Let not the Popes object Emperours; never was any more immane than they. <hi>Nero</hi> and <hi>Caligula</hi> were the grandest tyrants of them all, monsters of men: and thinke you, we shall not find Popes to parallell them? <hi>Nero</hi> slew his mother and his sister: so did <hi>Paul</hi> the third. Wee wonder at <hi>Caligulaes</hi> wish, that all the <hi>Romanes</hi> heads were standing on one necke, that at one blow hee might behead them all. Pope <hi>Martins</hi> is more monstrous, that all <hi>Germanie</hi> were but one lake; that all the <hi>Germanes</hi> might be drowned in it at once. Was not this Pope adrie, that thirsted for such a sea of bloud? And is not <hi>Rome</hi> worthy to be call'd the sea of bloud? The sea is not the fuller, though all the rivers runne into it. <hi>Rome</hi> is not the lesse thirstie, though she have drunke the bloud of all those thousands. Yea many thousands moe have not quencht her slakelesse thirst: but Popes are still like <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians; Quo plius bibunt plus sitiunt,</hi> saith <hi>Plinie,</hi> the more they drinke, the more they are adrie. Drith after drinke, a symptome of drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse. The drunkard in the <hi>Prov.</hi> saith, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> I will have more of it. The man will have cuppe after cuppe, and call for the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, ere the first be drunke: the woman will have bloud to touch bloud, one murther to overtake an other. The Drunkards in <hi>Esay</hi> cry, <hi>cras sicut hodie;</hi> they will drinke on the morrow, as they did the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; nay <hi>multò ampliùs,</hi> to morrow shall exceede to day. The womans unquenchable appetite of bloud, growes greater by drinking it.</p>
            <p>To draw unto an end: the drunkard though in one house he have drunk too much, yet will thence unto an other, from it unto a third: and though he reele already, yet hee will to moe, till he be dead drunken. <hi>Italy</hi> sufficeth not this drunken womans thirst: there is Saints bloud in <hi>France,</hi> in <hi>Germanie,</hi> in <hi>Britanie,</hi> she must have some of that.</p>
            <p>What the drunkard drinkes, hee will have it strong; and there must be store of it. The Pope is growne of late daintie and greedie too. Saints bloud is all good; but his holinesse must have both the best of it, for the kinde, and abundance for the quantitie. For the one, subjects bloud serves him not; hee must have Kings, not <hi>Sanctorum</hi> onely, but <hi>unctorum</hi> too, not the bloud of Gods Saints alone, but the bloud of Gods anointed. Yea sometimes hee hath longed for the Emperours owne bloud; he hath long'd for it, and had it. The <hi>French</hi> Kings bloud he will shortly claime by custome. Our last Queenes bloud of ever blessed memorie, how often attempted he to taste of it? Our gracious Soveraignes bloud hath he not assaied to have a say of it?</p>
            <p>For the other, the Pope is the angry man in <hi>Ecclesiasticus,</hi> blood is as nothing in his sight. Like the great <hi>Behemoth, he thinkes to draw up
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:173124:126"/> Iordan into his mouth,</hi> whole floods of blood into his belly. Not one mans blood alone, but multitudes at once; he loves Massacres. Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse the <hi>Sicilian Evensong</hi> by Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> 3. witnesse the bloody wedding at <hi>Paris,</hi> by <hi>Gregory</hi> 13. Nay witnesse the most wonderfull in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Massacre, that ever man on earth, or fiend in hell devised, that desperate, that divelish, and most damned Conspiracie of the Gunpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der treason, on this day now six yeares. What eare heares it, but it tingles? What tongue tells it, but it trembles? Whose haire stands not at the hearth of it? Whose heart quakes not at the thought of it? The Pope had curst us often with a horrible curse, as <hi>David</hi> termed <hi>Shimeis</hi> curse with <hi>anathema maranatha,</hi> with <hi>anathema Sathanatha.</hi> His Priests had prayed against us: they had calld on all the Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels to confound us. When they saw all would not serve, but we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spered the more; they thought with themselves, as <hi>Iuno</hi> doth in <hi>Virgil Flectere si ne queo Superos, Acheronta movebo;</hi> if <hi>Michael</hi> and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels would not helpe them, the Devill and his angels should. If hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven had no fire for them, they would have it out of hell. If they could not throw us downe, they would blow us up. A type of <hi>Tophet</hi> (as a learned Bishop tearmeth it) a petie <hi>Synopsis</hi> of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rha,</hi> and of the fiery deluge at the day of doome, the fearefull confla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration of the world at Christs comming. Well doth <hi>Baronius</hi> paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel the now Pope <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Gregory</hi> the seventh, whose name was <hi>Helde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brand.</hi> For whence could such a furious such a sulphureous flame take fire, but from a brand of hell? It was not done; it was designd. <hi>Quid non Ebrietas designat?</hi> what will not a drunken man designe?</p>
            <p>The Kings owne sacred person, his Queene, and all their children, all the reverend Patriarkes and Prelats of the Church, all the Honorable Lords of the Councell and Nobility, all the grave and learned Iudges, all the flower of the Commonaltie, these cursed plotters would have devoured at once. They would (they said) have sent us like unto <hi>Elias</hi> up to heaven in fire.</p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> saw a woman drunken? that terme should have beene turn'd. They would have clipt Gods Greeke, and have made <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a woman sacrificing with the blood of Saints. <hi>Rome</hi> glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in her unbloody sacrifices: but now shee would have sacrificed blood; a living, holy, and reasonable sacrifice; not beasts, but men; not dead, but quicke; not the guilty blood of malefactours, but the holy blood of Saints; a living, holy, and reasonable sacrifice: and therefore also acceptable unto God. For Christ foretold of her, that the bloody persecutour should thinke hee did God service; and the Pope hath profest it, profest it publickly, and to murther such is me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious. Hath he not Scripture for it? <hi>Talibus enim hostiis promeretur Deus, God is merited,</hi> heaven is purchased <hi>by such sacrifices.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will not say with <hi>Ieremie, Goe to the Isles of Chittim, and send to Kedar; see if such things bee there:</hi> but looke if Turkes, if Tartars, if all heathen lands can patterne such a plot. I will say with <hi>Esay, Quis vidit? quis audivit?</hi> what eye hath ere beheld, what eare hath ever heard so egregious, so prodigious a project, as was this? <hi>Hyppolytus</hi> saith in <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca, Nullam caruit exemplo nefas,</hi> never was so vile a villanie, but it
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:173124:126"/> had example. Aske all Antiquitie <hi>ab orbe condito,</hi> the Rolles and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of all countries, of all times, <hi>Caruit exemplo nefas,</hi> the world can not sample it. So malitious, so mischeivous, so monstrous a machina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, never once entred into imagination. <hi>Iupiters</hi> sacrifice, were called <hi>Hecatombae</hi> because they offered up 100. beasts at once. Those Popish miscreants thought they would doe more, have many <hi>Hecatombaes,</hi> the bloud of many hundreds of men at one sacrifice.</p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> wondred at the woman with great marvell; well worthy to be wondred at by the whole world: that as (Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> saith) <hi>Praela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> should be <hi>Pilatus,</hi> a Shepheard a Wolfe; that <hi>Pontifex</hi> should be <hi>Carnifex;</hi> the Bishop of soules, a Butcher of Saints; the Churches Head, to maime the Churches Bodie: to make <hi>Sion</hi> a <hi>Golgotha,</hi> a place of skulls, and <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> an <hi>Akeldama, a field of bloud:</hi> When but a Popish Duke, the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> was slaine by <hi>Poltrot, Duraeus</hi> a Papist could say of it, that the Christian world had not seene a fact, <hi>funestius luctuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius,</hi> more dolefull, more direfull, what shall we say of this; of a slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, such a slaughter for time, for place, for manner, of such persons, of such a multitude? Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> wondered at the woman: let us wonder at the man, the man of Sinne, the man of Sathan, the man of bloud, the man of <hi>Rome.</hi> But let us wonder most of all at his wonderfull Salvation, who at the very point of our going downe, this greedy throte, to have beene swallowed up unrecoverably, pulled us by his power even from betweene his jawes.

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE remaines of a Scripture, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you remember I have handled hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in the beginning of the verse. The sense of this clause hangs on that; maime of it selfe; must be perfitted by it. <hi>I saw a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man drunken with the Blood of Saints, and with the Blood of the Martyrs of Iesus.</hi> This woman is described here to bee <hi>drunken; that</hi> vice (say no more) is <hi>odious.</hi> But heres more, drunke with <hi>Blood;</hi> thats brutish and Barbarous. Tis worse yet, <hi>Impious;</hi> drunken with Saints blood. Thus farre I have already gone, in the first clause. My Text now leades me further; cries <hi>Plus ultra;</hi> the woman yet more wicked; drunken againe; thats in the Particle (<hi>And</hi>) the first word of my Text; with Blood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, the second word; a stronger blood, then <hi>Saints, the Blood of Martyrs;</hi> even <hi>the Martyrs of Iesus.</hi> This woman (you shall afterward heare) was a Christian. But shee wants but one degree of the <hi>Iewes</hi> wickednesse. They shed <hi>Iesus</hi> owne blood; shee his <hi>Martyrs; And with the Blood of the Martyrs of Iesus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All the difference of the matter of my Sermon now, from my former of the first branch, is in the materialls onely of the drunkennesse. The same Seer, Saint <hi>Iohn;</hi> the same object, the <hi>woman;</hi> in the same case, <hi>drunken,</hi> with the same liquor, <hi>Blood.</hi> But not the same Blood. That was but <hi>Saints</hi> Blood; this is <hi>Martyrs.</hi> I noted in this woman the
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:173124:127"/> last time, three unlovely qualities; unsatiable, because <hi>drunken;</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifull, twas with <hi>Blood;</hi> and ungodly, twas <hi>Saints</hi> blood. I note two now; <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> more drunkennesse, and worse. More, in the <hi>Quid, And</hi> with the <hi>Blood:</hi> worse in the <hi>Quorum,</hi> of the <hi>Martyrs of Iesus.</hi> Of the severall words in order.</p>
            <p>The first, though but a Particle, would not bee slighted; tis but a thinne word, but weighty. It both couches one word under it, and also couples another. <hi>And,</hi> that is, and drunken: twas exprest before; must bee here understood. What man almost is drunken but once one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? <hi>Ebrius</hi> proves lightly <hi>Ebriosus;</hi> love of drink turnes act into habit. <hi>Noah</hi> indeede was but once, <hi>Lot</hi> but twice; both righteous men. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sinnes haply are but once done. A man steales, or kills once in all his life, but once onely. But the lusts of the flesh rest not in one act, itch all for Iteration. Love either of strong drinke, or strange women, beware all men of both; yeeld but once to either; without Gods speciall grace, thy heart is caught, and thou wilt, if thou maist, bee assidious in the sinne. Not to instance in whoredome, lest I stray too farre, heare the wise man, <hi>Prov. 23. ult.</hi> the drunkard cries <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, he will to the Wine againe: Heare the Prophet, <hi>Esay 56. ult.</hi> they cry, <hi>cras, sicut hodie,</hi> they are drunke to day, will bee to morrow. So doth the woman here, shee is drunken, and drunken. I will presse the word no further, because tis not exprest. What neede I, when the next word is of the same argument?</p>
            <p>All drunkennesse is not by wine, or strong drinke, though by the one lightly. The <hi>Thracians</hi> and <hi>Scythians</hi> us'd to burne certaine Herbes, to be drunken with the smoke. That barbarisme our English nation useth too much, in a base <hi>Indian</hi> Weede. It is pittie, men of good parts should be drunke so. They should leave it to idle and emptie heads, witlesse and worthlesse. But the woman in my Text is drunke with Blood. Thats <hi>Canniballs</hi> drinke. Of that savage beverage I spake largely the last time out of the former clause. It was there, and tis here. The woman to her drunkennesse addeth thirst; hath supt up already so much Blood, that shee is drunken. Yet shee will have more. Blood in the clause before, and Blood in this. The particle couples them; that as the Prophet speakes, <hi>Hosea Chap. 4. vers.</hi> 2. Blood may touch Blood.</p>
            <p>Calld I this quality Brutish and Barbarous? It is worse. Savages are drunke, but not with Blood; and beasts will drinke Blood, but not be drunke with it. The woman exceeds both; for shee doth both. At this the Apostle wonders, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, with great wonderment. He may: that a woman by nature of better temper, and lesse thirstie, then man, should be <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Aelians</hi> terme, should love drinke; tis ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd: should bee <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a great drinker, more absurd, should drinke drunke. But the drinke to be Blood too, strangely unnaturall: As S. <hi>Basil</hi> saith of <hi>Herods</hi> wife, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, her meate was slaughter, and her drinke blood.</p>
            <p>And yet why should Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> wonder so much? Sweete things best please the palate, and nourish most. Blood is sweet. Then wonder not, if she love Blood. And the sweetest drinkes quench the thirst least,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:173124:128"/> make one more dry. Then marvaile neither if shee drinke much, if with <hi>Solomons</hi> drunkard shee cries <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>more, more;</hi> if with <hi>Esaies</hi> drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers shee cry, <hi>Cras,</hi> drunken to night, appoint to meete to morrow; if with the <hi>Horse▪ leeches</hi> daughters shee cry still, <hi>Give, Give:</hi> as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satiable, as the ground, as the grave, nay as fire, that never cries, enough. And what, if there be oddes besides too in the Blood? if as in Wines, so in Bloods also one be sweeter then an other? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there is; and thats the next word in my Text, <hi>the blood of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs.</hi> Thats <hi>Vinum Cos, Sanguis Cos</hi> to her, the neatest of all bloods.</p>
            <p>All Blood is good; none comes amisse to this woman in her thirst. But a full belly kickes a hony combe. Sometimes she is wanton: then common blood contents her not. It must be holy blood; <hi>the blood of Saints.</hi> Thats in the clause before. Shee is more dainty in this. Saints blood was sweete; but shee will have sweeter yet, <hi>the blood of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,</hi> the sweetest of all bloods, save Christs onely, the blood of <hi>Iesus Martyrs,</hi> sweeter then all bloods, saving <hi>Iesus</hi> owne. <hi>Right pretious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his Saints, David</hi> saith. I will say, right pretious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his Martyrs. Martyrs excell Saints. Both are not one. Martyrs are all Saints; but not all Saints Martyrs. Saints meane no more, then <hi>Holy men,</hi> beleevers in the Gospell, and obeyers of the Law; Men of Faith, and holy life. But a <hi>Martyr</hi> is a <hi>Sealer of the Gospell with his blood.</hi> Not a patient endurer of persecution onely; that makes but a Confessour; but a Dier too for Christ; a willing, nay a joyfull expender of his blood, though in never so shamefull or fearefull kind of death, in the Cause of Christ. Such here the Apostle meanes by the <hi>Martyrs of Iesus.</hi> The Greeke word is much wider, meanes <hi>any</hi> witnesse. Saints in that sense are all <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: All Saints <hi>Adulti,</hi> are Christs witnesses, testifiers of his Truth. <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Anna</hi> were Christs Martyrs so. Yea the <hi>Romane</hi> Centurion, though a heathen was; he bore witnesse at the Crosse, that Christ was Gods Sonne. Nay, <hi>Iudas</hi> the traitour was, witnesse of Christs Innocency. A repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, a witnesse. Nay, the very devils were, cryed unto Christ, <hi>Iesus, thou Sonne of God.</hi> Much more are Saints in that large sense. But in all Tongues, saving Greeke, a Martyr is a loser of his life for the Gospell: and often in Greeke too, in Ecclesiasticall writers. They have their warrant hence: Saint <hi>John</hi> cals them here, <hi>the Martyrs of Iesus.</hi> Thats the last word in my Text. One word of it; and then to Application.</p>
            <p>There is a <hi>Pseudomartyr,</hi> (Papists call <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> so) a false Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr. All good things have their counterfaits. Falshood steales Truthes titles. The devill is Gods ape; puts all his appellations on his Ministers. Angels, Prophets, Apostles, Martyrs, and all, sathan hath too. There are the Dragons angels, <hi>Apoc. 12. 7. Pseudoprophetae, Pseudapostoli, Pseudomartyres;</hi> sathans angels, sathans prophets, his apostles, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs too. Heresie hath her martyrs, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, multitudes of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, saith <hi>Eusebius.</hi> There are in the Church history the martyrs of <hi>Montanus,</hi> of <hi>Arius,</hi> of <hi>Donatus. Rome</hi> too boasts of her martyrs. Shee might 13, 14, 15. hundred yeares agoe. Many of her Bishops suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferd
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:173124:128"/> in those times. Shee may not now. Shee does. Not of Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> onely, slaine long since; but of Saint <hi>Campian,</hi> Saint <hi>Garnet,</hi> and some more, but of late yeares. These are the Martyrs of <hi>Iesuites,</hi> not of <hi>Jesus.</hi> They dyed not in Christs cause: and tis <hi>Causa,</hi> not <hi>Poena,</hi> makes a Martyr, Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith. Martyrdome is <hi>in Causae bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitate, non in Poenae acerbitate,</hi> in the goodnesse of the cause, not in the sharpenesse of the paine. It is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as the Greeke tragicke termes it, a foolish death, when the cause is naught. They were trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, not martyrs; suffered not for their Faith, but for their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. <hi>Campian,</hi> Father <hi>Campian,</hi> a sonne of treason too. He had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concild to <hi>Rome</hi> 10000 in one yeare, boasted of it. But Father <hi>Garnet,</hi> a Father of a brood of Vipers, the most miscreant hell-hounds, that ever <hi>Britaine</hi> bred, the contrivers of a plot, yea almost (but for Gods Almighty preserving us) performers of the dismallest and most damned designe, that hell had ever hammerd. These are <hi>Romes</hi> martyrs not <hi>Martyrs of Iesus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These are teachers and beleevers of heresies and lies. <hi>Et vbi non est veritas Christi, ibi non est veritas Martyrii,</hi> saith <hi>Apollinaris,</hi> where true faith is not, theres no true Martyrdome. All their sufferings will not serve. A red colour is not beautifull, if it be not grounded on a faire white. The paine hath no grace, if the sufferer have no truth. Death for crime is no Martyrdome. I will not give the title of a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr to <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> though Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> terme him so. <hi>Iohn</hi> dyed for checking <hi>Herod,</hi> not for Christ. Yea Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> was bold to call the <hi>Bethleem</hi> Infants, <hi>Martyrs.</hi> So was <hi>Ireneus</hi> too: both in their zeale, and <hi>hyperbolice.</hi> For both of them else where call Saint <hi>Stephen,</hi> the first Martyr. Nay Saint <hi>Cyprians</hi> zeale went further, cald the crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed theife a Martyr too: imitating belike his Master <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who calles the three Children in the furnace, Martyrs. Hee had better ground, then Saint <hi>Cyprian;</hi> and yet I hold, hee spake too in <hi>Hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bole.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But why saith Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> here, <hi>Martyrs of Iesus?</hi> are not all Martyrs so? All are, if meant <hi>vnivoce.</hi> If the terme be put on any else, it is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

            <p>Now for their Number <hi>Gathering,</hi> argues pluralitie; but pluralitie is<note place="margin">β.</note> not alwayes multitude. Christ (whom wee must not teach to speake) calls it a gathering together, even of two or three, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 20. Here are many.

            <p>Note yet another thing; the head of this conspiracie is a sonne of<note place="margin">γ.</note>
               <hi>Levi.</hi> Not <hi>Issach ar,</hi> an Asse, but learned <hi>Levi,</hi> that deserves an <hi>Ecce! Levi,</hi> whom God had scattered among all the Tribes; of purpose to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct them all, to teach them to feare God, and the King, he to mutine against <hi>Moses!</hi> Nay <hi>Levi,</hi> set apart for the service of the Sanctuary, here to goe apart, as it is <hi>vers.</hi> 1. to rise against the Priest, to faction a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Aaron!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One thing more yet. <hi>Corah</hi> stirres not alone, keepes not his conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racie<note place="margin">δ.</note> within his owne coate; but runs out to <hi>Reuben,</hi> joynes with another Tribe, as evill-eyed as he against both Prince and Priest. It would be honour to them too, to humble both: yea great profit to them too, to pull <hi>Aaron</hi> downe. Might they prevaile, the availes of the Sanctuary a share of them at least might light among them. If every man that would, as in <hi>Ieraboams</hi> dayes, might consecrate himselfe; the Emolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Altar, first-fruits, tenths, offrings, all the fees of <hi>Levi</hi> had fallen to them alike, who so listed to bee Priest.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>so great a man. [But indeede their hearty meaning was to aspire to their places; the one to the Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the other to the Micre; the one would be the Prince, the other the high-Priest.] And they had very good opportunity to conspire; because the Tents of <hi>Raben</hi> were neere unto the <hi>Cohatbites,</hi> both on
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:173124:130"/> the same side of the Tabernacle. Neighbours might soone consort to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. This be noted in the persons of this Insurrection; applie it, if you please, ere we goe on unto the Act.</p>
            <p>Looke <hi>Moses</hi> to his throne, and <hi>Aaron</hi> to his Chaire; heres a messe of Malecontents, that looke with evill eye at both; <hi>Corah, Dathan, On,</hi> and <hi>Abiram.</hi> A masse of malecontents in Church and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, that wish both states were altered; [betterd they say.] <hi>Moses</hi> names his; I may not ours. If I must, let it be <hi>Legeon, quia multi sumus,</hi> for they are many. First, for their quality; tis not <hi>Wat Tiler,</hi> and <hi>Iack Straw;</hi> though the Trowell and the Thatching Combe will not blush too, to checke the Sceptre, and the Mitre both. Tis not <hi>Demetrius,</hi> or <hi>Alexander,</hi> a Silver-smith or Copper smith, not hee that holds the Plough, nor that tarrieth by the Anvill, the tradesman, or the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman, for the Laitie. Tis not the poore Curate (let that terme of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend none, for we are but Curates under <hi>Aaron</hi> all) tis not the meane Minister, meane either in his meanes or knowledge, for the Clergie. But for the Lay, the Gentleman, the Knight, (I may goe no higher) men of great states, and commanders in their Countries have doted upon Discipline, the diminisher of regall, but the demolisher of all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopall authority. Their mutinie is not so direct against <hi>Moses,</hi> as against <hi>Aaron;</hi> though <hi>Moses</hi> must fall too, if that I doll rise. Prelacie hath potent adversaries, Lay. <hi>Levi</hi> hath many things, would doe <hi>Reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ben</hi> great pleasure, and for the Church, the choise and chiefe of it, men of speciall gifts, and graced with degrees in Schooles, yea and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferd to by <hi>Moses</hi> to roomes of great revenue; not Deanes, and Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacons, (they are in their account but Popish dignities) but masters of Hospitalls, and Preachers in gainfullest and most conspicuous Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, have risen against <hi>Aaron,</hi> preacht and printed both against the Prelacie. Thats for their Note, And</p>
            <p>For their Number, not like <hi>Iacobs</hi> yeares, evill and few; evill, but<note place="margin">β.</note> not few. Discipline is the <hi>Helena</hi> of Genevating spirits, or innovating heads. All Greece will rise for it. Thousands doe sigh for it, ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands seeke it, themselves say: they say more, ten times ten thousand, an hundred thousand hands would joyne for it. Cald I them <hi>Legion,</hi> because they are many? they are many <hi>Legions.</hi> Not 250. the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber here, but 50. times 250. all against <hi>Moses.</hi> They say no: but let him not trust them. A Prince cannot prosper under a Presbytery. But against <hi>Aaron</hi> all; profest. <hi>Cartwright</hi> saies, he shooke at the name of a Bishop: he must downe. And though I rather thinke, it (then) was the Bishops booke at which hee shooke, let <hi>Moses</hi> remember his owne Aphorisme, no Bishop, no King.</p>
            <p>The next thing noted was the chiefe Risers Tribe; <hi>Corah</hi> a Levite.<note place="margin">γ.</note> In this Note, and the next, I will not greatly charge our Clergie, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Moses. Levi</hi> hath beene lightly loyall to the King; saving the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish <hi>Levi,</hi> some Priests of <hi>Baal.</hi> Tis <hi>Aaron</hi> is their eye-sore: tis against the Bishop, that they bend their forces, band themselves. An un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde conspiracie. <hi>Corah</hi> against <hi>Aaron,</hi> of one tribe, one family, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers children.

<pb n="242" facs="tcp:173124:131"/> against me,</hi> saith the Church in the <hi>Canticles.</hi> Let <hi>Gens in Gentem,</hi> Nation rise against Nation, Realme against Realme. But let not in one Nation, <hi>filii regni,</hi> the children of one kingdome fall out betweene themselves. Let bee <hi>Manasses</hi> against <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and <hi>Ephraim</hi> against him, [and both against <hi>Iudah:</hi>] Let not one <hi>state</hi> oppugne another, the Temporaltie the Spiritualtie, the Spiritualtie it; much lesse the Church oppose to it selfe. But let not <hi>Levi</hi> rise within themselves. <hi>Pax vobis à vobis,</hi> have peace (saith <hi>Bernard</hi>) agree among your selves. Let not <hi>Vterini,</hi> children of one wombe, fall out in the wombe, <hi>Iacob</hi> take his elder brother by the heele. His brother? Nay, his father. Christ foretold it, but tis foule, children should rise against their fathers. The Bishops the Fathers of the Church: the inferiour Priests but <hi>Aarons</hi> sonnes. <hi>Etiam tu Fili,</hi> said <hi>Caesar</hi> to <hi>Brutus,</hi> what, thou my sonne too?</p>
            <p>Nay, <hi>Corah</hi> is more wicked, [<hi>etiam vilescam adhuc,</hi> he is a vilder fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low<note place="margin">δ.</note> yet;] he conspires, thats the last note in the persons: rests not in rising himselfe onely, calls the <hi>Rubenite</hi> to rout with him. Our factious Pharisees joyne with the Herodians against Christ, <hi>Iudas</hi>-like betray him into the hands of sinners. The pragmaticall presbyterian preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth against Prelacie unto Lay eares. A pleasing Argument to some se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, either schismaticall or sacrilegious. Both men of zeale, passive in the one, the zeale of Gods house cate up them: active in the other, they have a zeale to eate up Gods house; cry with <hi>Zebah</hi> and <hi>Zalman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah, Let us take the houses of God in possession.</hi> Twas once <hi>Simeon &amp; Levi,</hi> brethren in evill; tis now <hi>Reuben</hi> and <hi>Levi: Levi</hi> must bee one. <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees</hi> and <hi>Elders, Caiphas</hi> and <hi>Herod</hi> against Christ. <hi>Felix</hi> and <hi>Ananias</hi> against <hi>Paul.

            <p>Tis time wee leave the persons; come wee to the act; a wicked one. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Tis a gathering together; too good a name for it. <hi>Moses</hi> is cald the meekest man on earth.

               </gap> were assembled; the Kings <hi>sistunt se,</hi> set up themselves. Disordred meetings, which the Lawes warrant not, can have no assembler, save some <hi>Demetrius, Corah,</hi> and his compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.] Our <hi>Corahs</hi> and <hi>Dathans</hi> have not risen yet, not come forth in <hi>publicum:</hi> the wisedome of our Senatours hath prevented that they should not swarme. But they have laine out often; they have gathered together sometimes three score at once, in corners. Their Classes, Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods, Conferences have beene at least in <hi>Moses</hi> moderate terme, gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings together. Their petitions, supplications, admonitions, demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations, what were they but gatherings together? workes but of some
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:173124:131"/> one head happly, but of many hands. Their very Motions, Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; pend but by some one, but maintained by multitudes. Goe we on from the Act unto the Object.</p>
            <p>The Commotion is against <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron. Miriam</hi> might have warned them; she had mutind against <hi>Moses</hi> but a while before, and that much after their manner; what? hath God spoken but by him onely? God smote her with Leprosie. Yea the whole Congregation might have warned them: they all had murmurd against <hi>Moses</hi> hard before, and against <hi>Aaron</hi> too. They had cryed <hi>Lapidate,</hi> stone them with stones. God had smitten them with pestilence, had destroyed them all; but that <hi>Moses</hi> prayed for them. But ambition is oblivious; the aspirer is impudent, brazeth his brow even against God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Our English Cohathites, and Reubenites too,</hi> the presumptuous <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian,</hi> aimes not at <hi>Aaron</hi> onely, but at <hi>Moses</hi> too; requires as well equality in Common-wealth, as in the Church. <hi>Monarchie</hi> in the one, <hi>Aristocracy</hi> in the other, they heartily abhorre. In state Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall and Civill both, they plead and they plot for a popular pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. To cry downe Kings, they thinke is odious, those of them especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, that be subjects to a King, dare not be so bold. But they will dare limit him. He shall be cald King; but he shall not raigne, but by their Rules. Like a <hi>Lacedaemon</hi> King, he shall have an <hi>Ephorus</hi> to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure him: tis <hi>Fenners</hi> Divinity. Nay he shall be worse. The <hi>Spartane</hi> Kings had but five <hi>Ephori</hi> to curbe them: but he shall have fifty; hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds to checke him. Power hee shall have; but their Consistories shall confine it, shall controll it. Hee must submit his Scepter to their Synods, and his Diademe must ducke unto their Discipline. I would serve you with their phrase, but that tis so unmannerly, he must licke the dust of the Presbyteries feet.</p>
            <p>First for <hi>Corah,</hi> ill became it him, a Levite against the Magistrate. Preists should pray for Princes. But yet be it noted to the honour of the Clergy, the Iewes Clergy, here is but one <hi>Levite</hi> to above two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>Reubenites,</hi> one sonne of <hi>Levi</hi> to above two hundred Lay. I would twere so with ours. That it may be so, <hi>Aaron</hi> must looke to <hi>Levi</hi> in due time; see that he subscribe at his Ordination, at his Institution, at his License to Lecture in Cities and great Townes, where mostly these mutiners are bred and fed. Keepe them strictly to Church Canons: who should keepe them, if not <hi>Levi?</hi> Censure in time their irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities. <hi>Moses</hi> shall have more sober subjects both in <hi>Levi</hi> and in <hi>Reuben</hi> too, farre more then he hath.</p>
            <p>And for <hi>Aaron,</hi> makes <hi>O see</hi> such a matter, one should rebuke the Priest, <hi>c. 4. v.</hi> 4. the ordinary Priest? Here are fellowes feare not to rebuke the High Priest. Will you heare them? thats the next point; <hi>&amp; dixerunt, and they said.</hi>

            <p>The Person is plurall; but the Speaker is but one. They <hi>come</hi> all, but they cannot <hi>speake</hi> all; <hi>Corah</hi> is their mouth. Hee belike was learnd; he was a Levite. This was <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

            <p>The charge here is Presumption: tis more, that terme is too gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> and too slight; tis usurpation. Tis worse yet, Intrusion; <hi>why lift ye up your selves?</hi> A false charge, tis <hi>Calumnia,</hi> thats worse then <hi>Maledictio. That</hi> we must respite to his place. See first how they u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpe. <hi>Moses</hi> was of <hi>Levi:</hi> what right had hee to civill Rule? His Charge was in the Church; God had tedderd him unto the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle. Say that he were Lay: Yet <hi>Levi</hi> was but <hi>Israels</hi> third Sonne. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans</hi> Father was the first: it was <hi>Reubens</hi> right to rule, <hi>Iacobs</hi> first borne. What? will they make a custome of <hi>Major minori serviet? Isaac</hi> said it of his Sonnes: did <hi>Iacob</hi> of his too? <hi>Major minori serviet?</hi> should the eldest Sonnes seed bow to the younger Brothers brats? Thus <hi>Reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bens</hi> Sonnes thought haply. But they should have considered, that their Father lost his birth right by abusing <hi>Iacobs</hi> bed.</p>
            <p>And for <hi>Aaron,</hi> if the High Priesthood belongd to <hi>Levi, detur digniori:</hi> what was <hi>Aaron</hi> more then others? <hi>Corah</hi> was a <hi>Cohathite</hi> as well as he. Twas his right rather, of more worth, more wealth, more yeares, then he, <hi>Iosephus</hi> saith. He tooke great scorne to serve under <hi>Aaron;</hi> and that his Cozen <hi>Elizaphan</hi> should be set over the <hi>Coha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thites,</hi> but yet under <hi>Eleezer Aarons</hi> Sonne too. That all the Sonnes of <hi>Cohath</hi> must have their severall services assigned by <hi>Aarons</hi> sonnes, men as well bred, as they, the Sonnes of <hi>Levi</hi> all; yet they to be as Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons and Subdeacons under them. Twas great indignity: hee would raise the People rather then endure it. And yet by his leave, both his Cozen, and himselfe came of younger brothers both. In this conceit of usurpation, <hi>Abiram</hi> and <hi>Dathan</hi> being gently called by <hi>Moses</hi> to come up to treat with him calmely of this question, answered him stubborne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and that twice, <hi>non ascendemus, we will not come up.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Are not the moderne Chieftaines of Church and Common wealth, checkt both by <hi>Lay</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> to take too much on them? Surely Bishops be. Nay Princes escape them not. Else would not some censure the Titles of Majesty, Lordship, and Highnesse; call them <hi>Soloecismos &amp; Barbarismos Aulicos,</hi> the incongruous Complements and barbarismes of the Court? and title them, that use them, <hi>Sericatos Nebulones.</hi> Nor would they call a King, a temporall Pope. And what have Princes to doe, to prescribe Ceremonies? to set Lawes to the Church? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">

Dares the Disciplinarian, take the oath of Supremacy in this conceit of Kings? Surely the rankest Papist may as well: As a reverend Bishop of our Church censures them, <hi>uter que in reges aequè injuriosi,</hi> papists and puritanes, both of
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:173124:132"/> them equally evill eyed to Kings. [But what meant <hi>Knox</hi> then to write to the Queene Regent, that shee was Supreme Head, Head of the Church? But that was but a wile, to winne her to suppresse the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacie.]</p>
            <p>But the Bishop is a bodie composed of usurpation, wholly compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of it. All he doth, all hee hath, is meerely usurpation. His Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crations, Ordinations, Collations, Institutions, Dispensations, Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Suspensions, Excommunications, all his Censures, his whole Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction, he takes them all upon him wrongfully, usurpes in all; so farre in some, as that hee is runne into a flat <hi>Praemunire.</hi> That whole authoritie is indeed the elderships. In a word, Prelacie is a pettie Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacie, a devillish <hi>Oligarchie,</hi> a meere Tyrannie. These the termes happly but of the maddest of mutinie. But even the modest too, the most moderate of them all thinke Bishops take too much on them. Too much title; Bishops they could beare: but why should they be Lords? Especially gracious Lords; a stile forbid by Christ expresly, <hi>Vos autem non sic.</hi> Too much power; let them be allowed Iurisdiction in the Church: but why should they meddle in the Common-wealth? Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar men deale with secular things? In the meane time, some of the titles, which they envie them, they can be content to assume unto themselves; right reverend Fathers, yea <hi>Cart-wright</hi> most reverend. The best is, <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> differ here. <hi>Bezaes</hi> wrong to Bishops, <hi>Calvin</hi> rights, and calls even Archbishops, a moderate honour.

               <hi>them.</hi> This is the <hi>Quia.

The holinesse of the people, Gods Presence in the Hoast: adde from the verses end, they are the Lords Congregation.</p>
            <p>See how this subtile cunning Sophister supparasites the people; thats Ambitions fashion too ever to be popular. If <hi>Absolom</hi> will raigne, he must put forth his hand, yea kisse every man he meetes. Yea besides complement, he must praise them too.

Then hee shall steale the hearts of all the men of <hi>Israel.</hi> The people here are holy, all holy every one of them; the Lord is among them; they are the Lords Congregation. The people all holy; and therefore they neede no Bishop to be over them. God is among the people; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they neede no Captaine to conduct them, no Magistrate to governe them. They are the Congregation of the Lord; and therefore neede not men to be Lords of the Congregation, neither my Lord Bishop, nor my Lord the King.

               </gap>, the man so powerfull to perswade? They must be poore fooles whom such pild reasons will perswade.</p>
            <p>First for their holinesse. Indeed <hi>Moses</hi> before had sanctified the
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:173124:133"/> people at the mount <hi>Sinai.</hi> They are called an <hi>holy Nation, Exod. 19. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> holy men.</hi> God seemes to dubbe them Saints, in the very phrase of Kings, when they give Honours, <hi>Estote sancti, be yee holy, Levit.</hi> 19. What then? Must one that is holy, have none to be over him? May there be no Magistrate, where the people are all Saints? Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Omnis anima, let every soule be subject;</hi> not all Saints onely, but all soules too, must be subject <hi>to the higher Powers.</hi> And yet by their leaves, that sanctifying of <hi>Moses,</hi> was but a preparing them to receive the Law. <hi>Moses</hi> did nought to them; that sanctifying was no more, than the washing of their cloathes, and abstaining from their wives against the giving of the Law. Nor did <hi>Estote Sancti</hi> make them holy <hi>ipso facto.</hi> It was not <hi>dictum factum:</hi> God told them, what they should be, not what they were.</p>
            <p>But say they were. Doth not holinesse receive <hi>magis &amp; minus?</hi> Are there not degrees of it. Else that proud Puritan was wrong in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>Sanctior sum, quàm tu; Stand away, touch me not, I am holier than thou.</hi> Be the people holy: <hi>Moses</hi> was more, <hi>Aaron</hi> was more. God spake to <hi>Moses</hi> mouth to mouth, and shewed him his similitude: and <hi>Aaron</hi> was anointed with the holy Oyle. <hi>Corah,</hi> to compare with them, to match himselfe, or his mutinous mates with them, <hi>Moses</hi> might well answer them in their owne <hi>Dialect, you take too much upon you, yee sonnes of Levi.</hi> And they might consider too, that the peoples holinesse was by <hi>Moses</hi> Ministrie. The Law, and the Oracles, Gods speciall holy things, the Arke and the Tabernacle, they were <hi>Per manum Mosis,</hi> they had them by his hand, both his and <hi>Aarons. He led them (David</hi> saith,) both led, and fed them too; nor that alone, but all the holy things they had, all the holy things they did, were all <hi>by the hands of Moses and Aaron.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Besides, <hi>Corah</hi> here equivocates, either beguiles the people, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulls himselfe. The people are all holy: that is, God had chosen them above all Nations, for his peculiar people, holy unto him. But to serve in the Sanctuary, to offer on his Altars, to be the Lords Ministers in holy things, they were not holy so: not all of them, nay none of them, saying the sonnes of <hi>Levi. Moses</hi> denies it not directly; he lists not to altercate; nor will he exasperate the seditious multitude; but yet is plaine enough. Tomorrow God will shew you, who is holy, saith meeke <hi>Moses.</hi> And how holy they were, Gods owne censure shewes, and their murmurings against God.</p>
            <p>But yet <hi>God was among them: Corah</hi> was right in that. For in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> middes of their Tents, in the Center of their Hoast was the holy Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, and the Arke of Gods presence: There was Gods Mercy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seate; and he dwelt betweene the Cherubims. But what then? The <hi>Quia</hi> failes there too. Needes not man, where God is? May not God, and man governe together? God supreme, man under him? God needs no helpe in ruling men. As he made the world, so he can manage it without meanes. But it is his pleasure to use meanes. What needeth the Lord the ministerie of Angels? Yet he made them ministring Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. God would divide the sea for the passage of his people; but by
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:173124:133"/>
               <hi>Moses</hi> Rod. God is among the people; and therefore no neede of Prince or Priest over them, it might be good Oratorie, but the Logicke is bad.</p>
            <p>Theres an Arrerage yet, peice of their grievance yet behind; twas named before, but respited. You have heard one charge, twas usurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: <hi>Ecce autem alterum,</hi> heares a worse; tis Intrusion, <hi>Cur elevamini, Why lift you up your selves?</hi> The <hi>Quia</hi> ws naught, it was seditious, the <hi>Cur</hi> is worse, tis Presumptuous and Calumnious. Inferiour <hi>Levites</hi> to rise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst High Priests, and people against Princes, both against both? <hi>O tempora!</hi> Subjects to come to Magistrates, with <hi>Curs</hi> and <hi>Quares?

What a malapart and insolent language have we here? And why should you lift your selves above the people? Not an ordinary <hi>Quare,</hi> tis not <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> why; but an imperious terme, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> whats the reason? Wee would know: so much is in the word. A right <hi>Ephorus,</hi> he must have account; they come Tribune-like, and expostulate with authoritie. But let the forme goe, come to the matter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moses</hi> &amp; <hi>Aaron</hi> are intruders; <hi>Cur elevamini, Why lift you up your selves?</hi> A spightfull aspersion, but a false. God had advanc't them both. <hi>David</hi> cleares <hi>Moses, Psal. 106. Electus ejus,</hi> he saith, <hi>God chose him.</hi> And for <hi>Aaron, Paul,</hi> is his Compurgatour, <hi>Heb. 5. 4. Vocatur a Deo, he was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of God.</hi> But thats all one. Spight will never say right. Envie hath a tooth, two teeth, gag-teeth both. The one growes inward to gnaw it selfe; the other outward to gnash at others. Emulation is ill tongued, a Sycophant: tis worse, Sycophants, but accuse, they slander not; En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie is a slanderer; not <hi>mordax</hi> onely, but <hi>mendax</hi> too, a false accuser, a <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a devill. <hi>Moses</hi> usurpes not, intrudes not; nor doth <hi>Aaron: à Domino factum est istud,</hi> it was the Lords doing. <hi>Moses</hi> was the meekest and modestest man on earth. Conscious to his owne defects, hee faine would have declin'd the office; humbly prayed pardon once, twice, thrice of God, even till God was angry: God laied it on him, hee usurpt it not. And for the Priesthood, <hi>Aaron</hi> sought it not; his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration was Gods owne command. But thats all one; <hi>Corah</hi> will take no knowledge of it: Yea, and they might remember, how great and many miracles the Lord had wrought by them, by <hi>Moses</hi> specially; and how God had graced <hi>Aaron</hi> before all the people, and honoured his offerings with his owne fire from heaven. But themselves aspir'd to their roomes; and selfe-love binds the eyes, blinds the eyes of the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious. Or say, they saw it, and well remembred it: yet should Ambition make conscience of a lie? Twas God lifted them both up, above their brethren. But pride is no Precision; and it is but a little he; but were it as bigge as a Camell, it would swallow it. <hi>Cur elevamini,</hi> they are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truders, <hi>Why lift you up your selves?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>See how pride dares charge Humilitie with Arrogance; vice chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge Vertue for Dishonestie. <hi>Ahab</hi> will call <hi>Elias</hi> a <hi>Troubler of Israel,</hi> when twas his Fathers house, and hee that troubled it. A rout here of aspring Spirits charge <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> with Ambition, with Intrusion. Wherefore are they come, but to rush into those roomes, which they
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:173124:134"/> would have them resigne. <hi>Corah</hi> would be <hi>Pontifex,</hi> and <hi>Dathan</hi> would be governour. At least wise He and <hi>Abiram,</hi> and <hi>On</hi> the sonne of <hi>Peleth</hi> would set up a <hi>Triumvirate.</hi> Agree they as they could, <hi>Corah</hi> would be Priest alone. He joynes no Levite with him in the Conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, for feare of a Competitour. Not onely <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a good Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritian, but as good a Polititian.</p>
            <p>And you the <hi>Corahs</hi> and <hi>Dathans</hi> of our Church, <hi>Vos autem non sic?</hi> Are there no <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> among Disciplinarians? Cry none of them, <hi>Cur ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vamini?</hi> Surely for <hi>Moses</hi> I will not challenge them. To charge him with Intrusion, is proper to the Papists. But Bishops are Intruders. Time serves not, nor is't fit, to recite the odious Calumnies, which these <hi>Corahs</hi> casts on that holy <hi>Hierarchie; Plaustra convitiorum,</hi> but <hi>menda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciorum,</hi> whole <hi>Iliads,</hi> whole <hi>Chiliads</hi> of false accusations. That worthy Archbishop <hi>Whitgift,</hi> of reverend memory, the glory of the Prelacie, and Honour of this Sea, by those shamelesse <hi>Schemeis</hi> was in this kind a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused above all others. Their termes beseeme not my mouth, nor your eares.</p>
            <p>Now whats the Catastrophe, the Conclusion of all this? Not that which these conspiratours either pretended, change of state, or intended shift of persons; buta Catastrophe indeed, a subversion of themselves, both persons and States too. All this rebellious rout, that had cried in their contumacie, <hi>Non ascendemus, we will not goe up,</hi> God judg'd, severely judg'd. They that that day would not goe up, God made the next day to goe downe, downe quicke, <hi>ad infernum,</hi> English that as you please. b. 32. 33.</p>

               </gap>, forward and backeward, though it be behoovefull often, yet it is not needefull here. The Argument of my Text is so absolute within it selfe, that to stand upon any dependance, any reference of it to the rest of the Chapter, were but idle curiositie. The name of an Elder, and the mention of honour in my Text, might occasion me by the way to deale with the <hi>Domonstratour</hi> and <hi>Martin,</hi> with the rest of that faction: but many reasons move me to spare that labour. And indeede, the people in such places as this, being of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves too wise and too ready in argument and questions, it behooveth
<pb facs="tcp:173124:135"/> the Preacher, to teach you rather Dutie than controversie. Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, both for my better proceeding, and your more easie understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, I divide both this Text, and my Sermon into these two generall parts, the dutie of Elders, and their reward, <hi>Officium &amp; praemium,</hi> their due and their dutie.</p>
            <p>The dutie is two fold, Government and Doctrine, to be performed on the part of the elder; the reward also double, reverence &amp; maintenance, to be performed on the part of the people. By <hi>Elders,</hi> I meane the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours of the Church, the Exposition not mine, but of the most and best Writers so called, not for their years; for <hi>Timothie</hi> was the chiefe of the Elders, and the Archbishop of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and yet he was young, <hi>c. praeced. ver.</hi> 12. but for their elderly vertues; who, as the ancient and gray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed by their sagenesse and experience doe rule and teach families and societies; so they for their gravitie and knowledge, the two com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations of the aged, are set over the Church, which is Gods house<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, and his common wealth: partly <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to governe it, and partly <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>To labour in it by Word and Doctrine, i.</hi> to teach and instruct it: even as the Magistrates of this citie, are called Aldermen, <hi>i.</hi> Eldermen; not for their age, which sometimes is not so great, but because for their gravitie and wisedome, they are meete to governe their severall wards.</p>
            <p>I come now unto the severall parts of my Text, and first, unto the first duty of the former part, which is Governement, [<hi>The Elders which governe well</hi>] For this; being to speake in an assembly, a great part whereof is like to the noble men of <hi>Berroea</hi> in <hi>Act. Apost.</hi> able and ready to search, whether those things that are delivered, are so indeede, I may not forge any interpretation of mine owne braine; but I will follow the exposition of the greater, and the sounder part, both of the ancient Fathers, and of the latter Writers; who expound this Government of the Pastour, to be his guiding of the people by example of life. The Travellour ignorant of his way, useth either a directer or a guide. Our life is likened in the Scripture to a way; wherein that the Christian may walke without straying, God hath ordained his Ministers, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to tell the way, which is the Preaching of the Word, but also to be lodesmen themselves unto the people, which is the governing of them by the integritie of their owne conversation. And this Exposition is confirmed both by conference of Scripture, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 8. and 14. Where the same word, that is here in the Originall, is translated to shew forth good Workes. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

And this may be amplified by foure regards, the first is, of God: the second, of their Ministrie; the third, of the people; the fourth, of themselves. For the first: No <hi>Levite,</hi> that had any kind of blemish, might come neere the Lords Altar, <hi>Levi. 21. pen.</hi> The shadow in a Type hath a proportionable truth in the body. The blemishes in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the Priests under the Law, were figures of the sins in the soules of the Ministers under the Gospell: and as God removed them from Ministring at his Altar; so he repelleth these from preaching his Word. <hi>Psal. 50. 16.

            <p>The Ministers, are the Lords servants, and like unto the servants of <hi>Solomon,</hi> are alwayes to stand before the face of their Lord. Now the Lords eyes cannot behold ungodlinesse; but as their is none unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse in himselfe; so is his charge to all that serve about him, <hi>Estote sancti, quia ego sum sanctus.</hi> Nothing polluted may come in his sight: All things about him must be holy, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3. 5.

            <p>For the second; The Ministers are the bearers of the Lords Vessells, and must therefore be cleane. For the Pharisees, whose righteousnesse,<note place="margin">Esay 52. 11.</note> our righteousnesse must exceed, if you will enter into the Kingdome of heaven, had this regard, not to touch their meats and drinkes which are Gods gifts, with common and unwasht hands. The Lords material Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, the vessels of the Sanctuary, they were holy, <hi>ut suprà,</hi> his spirituall Vessels, his Word and Sacraments are much more holy, and those that beare them before the people must be sanctified.

Priesthood and Prophecie, though in former ages, distinct functions, doe now both concurre in the Ministrie; and therefore hee must be a double <hi>Nazarite,</hi> abstaining from all spirituall drunkennesse of sinne, and restraining all the whorish lusts of the flesh. And seeing his heart must be the storehouse of the Word, and his lippes the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verers of the Law, neither may the one, or the other be uncircumcised, but wickednesse and corruption, as an uncleane foreskinne, must be cut from them both, least by their filthinesse he pollute those things which God hath purified.

               </gap>, to hogges and dogges, <hi>i.</hi> his sacred mysteries committed unto wicked men. What should a pretious stone do in a woodden ring, or a ring of gold in a swines snout? What should the Scriptures, which the <hi>Psamist</hi> resembleth to gemmes and gold sound out of the mouth of an ungodly Minister? <hi>Saul</hi> himselfe, though a wicked man; yet when he prophesieth, hee is changed into another man, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. 6.</p>
            <p>For the third; the Pastors of Gods Church ought to be ensamples un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Christs flocke, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 3. And though it be truly said, <hi>Vivimus legibus non exemplis,</hi> and Christ biddeth the people to doe as the Pharisees say, not as they doe, yet the common people are of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilians opinion, <hi>Quod exemplo fit, jure fieri videtur.</hi> Example is a kinde of warrant. <hi>Suadet loquentis vita, non oratio: Poeta▪ <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Menand.</hi> it is the life, not the learning of the Preacher, that perswadeth the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Sinne simple in the people, is double in the Preacher, for he offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth both <hi>peccato</hi> and <hi>exemplo;</hi> it is both <hi>scandalū populi, &amp; odiū ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rii:</hi> even <hi>scandalum</hi> in both his senses; an offence unto the people, and a scandall to his calling.</p>
            <p>For the one: The Minister, as he is Christs Disciple, so hee should be his follower, proving those things in his life, which he preacheth in his doctrine, that he may say unto the people, as Christ doth, not onely <hi>Praeceptum do vobis, Iohn</hi> 13. 34 but also, <hi>Exemplum dedi vobis, ver.</hi> 15. and as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith to the <hi>Philippians, 3. 17. Be ye followers of me.</hi> For <hi>vitae Clericorum</hi> should be <hi>Libri laicorum,</hi> the lives of the Cleargie, the books of the Laitie, saith one of the Fathers, the conversation of the Priest, the Looking-glasse of the people. The preachers are the Lords builders, and the people are the building, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 9. unlesse the life of the Minister doe edifie, as well as his doctrine; if hee build up heaven with his voyce, and hell with his life. <hi>Nazianz.</hi> he is an evill builder, and plucketh downe as much with one hand, as he setteth up with the other. It is the dishonour of the wicked man, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6. 13. but it will be his honour, to speake with his feete, and to teach with his fingers, <hi>i.</hi> to walke and to doe according to his owne doctrine. The Preacher is a voyce; so <hi>Malachie</hi> calleth <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> the first Preacher of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell: <hi>a voice,</hi> not a sound, not a dead sound, but a living voice, <hi>Viva vox,</hi> saith <hi>Bernard, i.</hi> both <hi>vita &amp; vox;</hi> least it be said to him, that the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demouian</hi> said to the Nightingale, <hi>vox es; praetereà nihil.</hi> To be short, if when the doctrine is <hi>mel,</hi> the life shall be <hi>venenum. Bern.</hi> hee enveno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
<pb facs="tcp:173124:136"/> the people with his example; and that is another <hi>Ieroboams</hi> sinne, to make <hi>Israel</hi> to sinne.</p>
            <p>For the other, the evill life of the Minister, is the dishonour of God, and the disgrace of his Ministerie. For as at the sight of good workes in the Preachers, the people doe glorifie their father, which is in heaven; so contrariwise at the view of their wicked lives, they will speake evill of the Gospell, and suspect Religion to be but policie to keepe men in awe; as being perswaded, that if their Doctrine were true, they would not themselves controll it by their owne practise; and therefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> is earnest in the point, <hi>Rom. 2. 21. Thou that teachest another, teachest thou not thy selfe, &amp;c, 1 Sam.</hi> 2. 17. There is an example. The <hi>Israelites</hi> abhorre the offerings of the Lord, through the sinnes of the Priests, the sonnes of <hi>Elie,</hi> and such a Minister may looke for at the mouthes of the people the checke in the Proverbe, <hi>Loripedem rectus, &amp;c.</hi> and that which is <hi>Iohn 9. 34. Thou art altogether a sinner, teachest thou us? Quid verba audiam, cum facta videam?</hi> What should wee heede what thou preachest, when we see how thou livest?</p>
            <p>The fourth and last respect of themselves. The Proverbe is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, <hi>O di sapientem, &amp;c.</hi> He is a badde Physition that cannot cure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. The Minister, whom neither the regard of God, whose messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger he is, neither the holinesse of his function, neither the offence of the people, will move to godlinesse of life, may haply be moved by that argument, by which all men are moved, the consideration of his owne private good. For commonly among men, when no place either of Logicke or Rhetoricke can perswade, yet the reason drawne from <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crum</hi> and <hi>damnum</hi> will not faile. Now the losse is of the two greatest things that man hath, the losse of his name, and the losse of his soule. For the one, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> saith the wise <hi>Ecclesiastes, a good name, &amp;c.</hi> for the other, the soule is valued at the worth of the whole world, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 26. and the praiser is he, who having ransomed so many, can best tell the value. For the first losse, the Preacher, that inveigheth against sinnes, whereof himselfe is guiltie, <hi>fometh out his owne shame, Iude vers.</hi> 13. and the shame is both unexcusable, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 1. and unavoidable, <hi>Matt.</hi> 5. 14. for he is as a citie set on a hill, and cannot be hid, and the eyes and eares of his people are both duly and daily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servers of his life. And though the Poet say of the contrarie, of private life, <hi>Benè qui latuit, benè vixit,</hi> close keeping covereth a multitude of sins; yet the Minister, as his life cannot be secret, so his shame cannot be hid. Nay, that which <hi>Plutarch</hi> said of the Prince, I may say of the Priest, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>ad principem ineruditum,</hi> in fine, a sinne in another man, as the scarre in the body, not to be seene for the garments cover it, but in the Priest, as a mole in the face, apparent to all men. For the second losse: shall he (saith Saint <hi>Bernard</hi>) that taketh the charge of other mens soules, neglect the charge of his owne? For what is the boxe the better for the sweete ointment, or the loose liver, for the prerogative of his Ministerie? It doth not vantage <hi>Balaam</hi> to be a Prophet, if hee will love the wages of unrighteousnesse. It will not boote <hi>Iudas</hi> to be Christs disciple, if he betray him. In the day of the generall assise of the world, the prophesying in Christs name will not
<pb facs="tcp:173124:137"/> serve for an answer. <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 22. but there shall bee a reply, and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence together, <hi>I know you not; depart from me, &amp;c.</hi> For God shall judge not after the Doctrine, but after the life of the Minister, and every man shall receive according to his workes. That which the Iewes spake falsely of Christ, is verified of such Prophets, that though they save others, yet themselves they cannot save. For hee that denounceth Gods judgements on those sinnes, which himselfe committeth, is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, his owne condemner, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 1. and Christ in the last day shall say unto him, <hi>ut Luk.</hi> 19. 22. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. And therefore to shut up this first duty, the Elders of the Church, the Pastours of Gods flocke, let them by <hi>Pauls</hi> example, 1 <hi>Cor. 9. ult.</hi> beat downe their owne flesh, and bring their owne soules into subjection, lest when they have preached salvation unto others, themselves become reprobates.</p>

               </gap>.</q>
            <p>The other duty is diligence in preaching, amplified by the parts, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation and doctrine, and enforced by the <hi>Emphasis</hi> of the trope, the word in the originall signifying not ordinary labour, but such as is with great strife and earnestnesse, and straine of all the strength, a metaphor borrowed from the toile of rowers in Gallies.

And this resemblance is exemplified in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures by two notable patternes of diligent Shepherds: The one in <hi>Iacob,</hi> who regarded not either the heat of the day, or the cold of the night, or the want of his sleepe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 31.

To conclude this duty, an idle Pastour, is an idole Pastour; for whereas hee should be as a Seer, so a Cryer; he is like the idolls in the <hi>Psalme,</hi> that have eyes and see not, and that have mouthes, but speake not.

               </gap>, what reward is sufficient for those things? The reward is (as I sayd in the beginning) double, countenance and maintenance. Double (you will say) is my Text, but where is mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance? it is not expressive, but it is inclusive. For it is both couched in the originall word <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which in the use of sundry Greek Authors, and of the Scripturs too, signifieth as well recompence as reverence, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of stipend as well as honour. And it is also consequent of the reason in the next verse, both out of the Law, <hi>the mouth of the Oxe that treadeth out the Corne must not be muzzelled,</hi> and out of the Gospel, <hi>the Laborer is worthy of his wages;</hi> the places are quoted in your Margins. For the one, the word of God is the <hi>Plow</hi> of the Lord, the people the <hi>Husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry, 1 Cor.</hi> 3. 9. The Ministers are the oxen to worke both at his plow, to breake up the fallow of mens hearts, and in the threshing floore, by the trampling of their feete, to tread out the Corne, which was the Iewes manner of threshing; And therefore as their mouths are open for the feeding of the people, so they must not be muzzelled from fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding themselves; and by feeding under a trope, is meant all kind of maintenance. For the other, the Ministers are Gods labourers, and by due desert may claime their reward. So doth the sonne of <hi>Syrach</hi> joyne both these together, 7. 31. Honour the Priests, and give them their portion.</p>
            <p>To speake of these two points severally and briefely; the first is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence.
<pb facs="tcp:173124:138"/> The calling of the Clergie, is an honorable calling. The argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are manifold, but I will comprise the most of them under three regards, the first of God unto whom it belongeth, the second, of the office it selfe; the third, of the commoditie redounding by it unto men.</p>
            <p>For the first; It is no small honour, that often groweth to the servant by the dignitie of his Lord. <hi>Rabsakeh, 2 Reg.</hi> 18. 24. will have <hi>Ezekiah</hi> the king to stand in awe of the least of the servants of his master, the great King of <hi>Assyria.</hi> Now the Minister is the servant of the great God of heaven and earth; whose service kings themselves may not scorne. <hi>David</hi> is but his servant. Nay the Angels, whose glory farre exceedeth the glory of kings, are but his servants. I say, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Ministers, they are Gods servants, <hi>Ier.</hi> 7. 25. they are the Lords men, 2 <hi>Reg.</hi> 1. 11. and may be called <hi>Grabriels,</hi> as well as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell: for what is <hi>Gabriel,</hi> but <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>i. Gods man?</hi> The calling of a servant, though it be base in it selfe, as requiring subjection, yet it is high in regard of the Lord. The mightiest subject in a kingdome is but servant to his Prince; the Kings sonne may not thinke scorne of the name, 1 <hi>Reg. 1. 19. Salomon thy servant, i. Davids.</hi> And <hi>Deo servire,</hi> is <hi>Regia servitus,</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (saith <hi>Numa</hi> in <hi>Plutarch</hi>) is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and not onely Kings and Angels doe glory in this title, as I sayd before, but Christ himselfe, whom the Apostle calleth <hi>Lord over all,</hi> as hee was man, hee was also Gods servant. Neither are the Ministers the lower sort of his servants to serve in inferiour places: for so doth <hi>Moab</hi> serve the Lord as well as <hi>Levi, Psal.</hi> 60. 8. but it is for base uses; but they are in his service preferred to offices, offices of trust, and offices of honour. They are the stewards of his house: they are his counsellours, <hi>Amos</hi> 3. 7. They are his Privie Counsellours and Secretaries, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 1. They are his Embassadours, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 10. For what is an Apostleship, but the Lords Embassage? a title of such honour, as Christ himselfe disdained not to be called an Apostle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 7. Nay, say but the most glorious creature that ever the Lord made, it is the Angell; and the Preachers, they are the Angels of God, <hi>Malachy</hi> 2. 7.</p>
            <p>The second regard, is of the office of the Minister: it is to beare the Lords vessells, <hi>Esa.</hi> 52. to be Gods mouth, <hi>Ier.</hi> 15. 19. Christs mouth, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 3. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the lips of Christ. The Preachers are the Ministers of the spirit, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6. &amp; therefore glorious. Yea <hi>Moses</hi> whose counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance the Israelits might not behold for his glory, they are more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious then he, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. They are masters, and therefore to bee reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and they are fathers, and therefore to bee honoured, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 6. for they are the fathers of our faith, and the masters of the assemblies, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 12. 11. To be short, their office is to <hi>labour in the word,</hi> an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable office. For the word is more excellent, then either gold or pretious stones, <hi>Iob</hi> 28. then the gold of <hi>Ophir,</hi> and the pretious <hi>Onyx,</hi> the <hi>Saphire,</hi> and the <hi>Topaz,</hi> yea <hi>then much fine gold, Psal.</hi> 19. and it is that pretious stone, which the Merchant in the Gospell bought with the sale of his whole substance.</p>
            <p>The last regard, but the greatest, is the profit of the ministery. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the greatest woldlings <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that that is of price, is of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimation; that that is profitable is honorable. The commodities are
<pb facs="tcp:173124:139"/> infinit, both temporall and spirituall. For the one; the Prophets and Preachers of the Word, they are the wealth, and the strength of the Land; the wealth, as we shall show in the last part; and the strength, they are the sinewes of the Realme, they are as <hi>Eliseus</hi> saith of <hi>Elias,</hi> and King <hi>Ioash</hi> of him, the charets and the horsemen of the common wealth. For the other, the spirituall commoditie, it is the greatest that can befall man, the salvation of the soules of men; valewed by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, <hi>Mic.</hi> 6. 7. by thousands of Rams, and tenne thousands of rivers of Oile, nay by the fruit, nay by the first borne of their owne bodies: but prised by Christ (as was said in the first part) by the worth of the whole world. Hence it is, that the onely authour of our salvation being <hi>Christ Iesus;</hi> the Ministers themselves in this respect, are called <hi>Christs, Psal.</hi> 105. 15. and they are called <hi>Iesus, i.</hi> Saviours, <hi>Obad. ver. ult.</hi> the savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours of their hearers, 1 <hi>Tim. 4. ult.</hi> the saviours of mens soules, <hi>Iames ult. ult.</hi> Nay they have Gods owne name given them; they are Gods, <hi>Exod. 4. 16. Moses</hi> is <hi>Aarons</hi> God, and 7. 1. <hi>Moses</hi> is <hi>Pharaohs</hi> God. If then the Physitians of the body be honourable, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 38. 1. and as the Poet speaketh, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, excellent above many others; how much more are Gods Ministers to be honoured, the Physitians of the soule; of whom the Saints of the earth, entred into Christs Kingdome, and become Saints in heaven, may say (as <hi>Carneades</hi> said of <hi>Chrysippus,</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) if Gods Ministers had not been, wee had not beene saved.</p>
            <p>To be short, to be Gods Priests, to be Gods Prophets, it is not a calling, as the world supposeth, either to be followed or to be reverenced only of the baser sort, but worthy of the best, &amp; to be honored of the highest estats. For the one, though <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> in policie, to bring religion into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, made Priests of the <hi>skirts, i.</hi> of the lowest of the people, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 12. 31. yet <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>Esay,</hi> both descended of Kings and Princes, thought not scorne to be the Lords Prophets. <hi>Melchisedech</hi> is both a King and a Priest; nay, Christ himselfe, in whom <hi>dwelt the Godhead bodily,</hi> was both a Prophet and Priest. The Hebrew name <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is a name of estate, signifying a Prince, as well as a Priest; that the Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors have doubted how to call <hi>Potiphar,</hi> the Prince or the Priest of <hi>On,</hi> and <hi>Iethro,</hi> the Prince or the Priest of <hi>Madian.</hi> Though it be now a dayes observed, that the sonnes of the noble, thinke the Ministery a dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement unto their birth, nay the sons of men of much lower condition, disdaine the calling, as a disgrace unto their house, unlesse they be such as God disabled in the time of the Law, the blind, the halt and the lame. Yet to speake as Christ doth in another case, it was not so from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, as you see in the forecited examples, <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>Esay,</hi> both of royall bloud, <hi>Sem Noahs</hi> sonne, his best beloved sonne, his eldest sonne, at the least after the disinheriting of <hi>Cham,</hi> disdained not the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, for so the learned doe take him to be <hi>Melchizedech;</hi> nay Christ, the Sonne of God, Gods onely beloved Sonne, Gods onely begotten Sonne, God had no more, and yet he is a Priest.</p>
            <p>For the other: as the calling is high, so it is to be honoured, not onely of the common sort, but of the honourable themselves. <hi>Obadiah,</hi> the
<pb facs="tcp:173124:139"/> governor of the Kings house, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18. 7. calleth <hi>Elias</hi> Lord, or if any take exception at that word; <hi>Naaman</hi> of high place in the court of the King of <hi>Aram,</hi> waiteth with his chariot and his horses, at the doore of the Prophet <hi>Eliseus, 2 Reg.</hi> 5. 9. Nay Kings themselves have honoured Prophets. <hi>Herod</hi> reverenceth <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist, Marke 6. 20. Benhadad</hi> and <hi>Ioram,</hi> two <hi>Kings,</hi> the one of <hi>Syria,</hi> the other of <hi>Israel,</hi> call <hi>Eliseus</hi> their father. <hi>Saul</hi> accounteth <hi>Samuels</hi> company to be his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and his honour, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 30. nay more than that, <hi>Nabuchodono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor</hi> the monarch of the world, falleth on his face, and boweth himselfe before <hi>Daniel. Chap.</hi> 2. 46. As these personages are not ordinary, so neither is the reverence due to the Ministery, ordinary, the <hi>Galathians</hi> receive Saint <hi>Paul</hi> as an Angell of God, yea as <hi>Iesus Christ himselfe, Gal.</hi> 4. 14.</p>
            <p>The contrarie unto this, to wit, the dishonouring of the Ministerie; the peoples opinion of them so base, that they thinke them unworthy to sit at their tables; but place them among their Hindes. Yea, haply they will in time, like unto Christ, thrust them to their manger to feede with their Oxen. I cannot stand upon, as being in matter as large and ample, as the other. Onely this I say of it in a word; that the disgrace of Gods Prophets, be it in word, or in deede, is alwayes rewarded with Gods judgements. For the one; the Boyes of <hi>Bethel</hi> that scoffed at <hi>Eliseus</hi> were rent in peeces with Beares, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 2. The mockers of his Messengers doe hale downe on their owne heads, the wrath, even the remedilesse wrath of the Lord, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36. For the disgraces done to them, the Lord accounteth them done to himselfe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. 8. For the other, <hi>Pashur</hi> smiteth and stocketh <hi>Ieremie, Ierem.</hi> 20. 2. but God changeth his name, <hi>v. 3. Pashur</hi> into <hi>Magor, i.</hi> authoritie into feare; that is feare active into feare passive. <hi>Ieroboam</hi> stretcheth out his hand against the Prophet, but his hand presently drieth up, and hee cannot pull it in againe, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 13. for the Lord will not have his anointed to be touched, neither his Prophets to have any harme. <hi>Psal.</hi> 105. 15. Thus much of the first reward of honour and reverence; a duty, though en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied and grutched to the Ministery in this age, yet due unto it, by the right both <hi>juris</hi> and <hi>aequi,</hi> both of Law, I meane, Gods Law; and of equitie, as hath beene declared. Humilitie (you will haply say) besee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the Divine; so doth it a Prince, as well as a Prophet; but both Prince and Prophet must humble themselves; they must not be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled of the people. For howsoever man debaseth the calling, God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alteth it; and though the Minister be in the opinion of the world, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith of himselfe, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 3. 8 lesse than the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, yet in Christs judgement, he is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, greater than the greatest, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 11. greater than <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi> who was the greatest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the sonnes of women.</p>
            <p>I come now unto the second reward, the last point of my Text, which is Maintenance; the proofes whereof for more easie order may be drawne into three heads, Gods owne Commandement, the Ministers owne desert, the Peoples owne profit.</p>
            <p>For the first; for the care of the <hi>Levites,</hi> the Lord gave unto his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple both Mandate and Caveate, <hi>Num. 35. 2. Command Israel, &amp;c. Deut.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:173124:140"/> 12. 19. <hi>Beware thou forsake not the Levite as long as thou livest.</hi> And for obedience of this commandement; the Scriptures have store of exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, I will cite but onely one, and that of him, who saith of himselfe, <hi>exemplum dedi vobis,</hi> the example of Christ himselfe, who as he payed tribute unto <hi>Caesar,</hi> so he offered also his duties unto the Temple, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. 24. This commandement of the Lord is controlled two wayes by the enviers of the state of the Cleargie; the one by Countermaund, and other by distinction. For the first, <hi>Numb.</hi> 18. 20. Gods owne charge is thus unto <hi>Aaron; thou shalt have no inheritance in the land, neither any part among the people.</hi> But the answer is easie, and the doubt onely <hi>de modo habendi.</hi> The <hi>Levits</hi> might have no part, namely hereditary, and as the other sonnes of <hi>Iacob</hi> had in the division of <hi>Canaan;</hi> but as it there followeth, the Lord was their portion, <hi>i.</hi> those things that were to be given to the Lord, were the portion of the Levites, as being his Priests. And therefore <hi>Bernards</hi> sentence is too severe; <hi>qui partem ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet in terra, non habebit in coelo.</hi> And that God is their portion, is but a silly objection, and a weake reason to show they must have nothing else. For the Lord was also <hi>Davids</hi> portion, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 57. and yet hee had besides in great abundance the temporall commodities of this life, meete for the state of a King.</p>
            <p>Another charge is in the Gospell, given by Christ unto the Twelve, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 9. forbidding them to have either gold, silver, mony, shoes, change of garments, or any provision. But to whom is this charge gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? not to the Apostles, but to the Disciples: and it is but for a time, and for one journey; that while hee abode among them, they might have some taste of the providence of God. And what skilleth it the Disciples to have ought of their owne, when God had ordained that all things should abundantly be ministred unto them of the people, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 35. But against the time wherein of Disciples they should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Apostles, to goe abroad and preach the Gospell to all Nations; and when as Christ was now to leave them; he giveth a quite contrary charge, <hi>vers.</hi> 36. to provide themselves to have all things necessary of their owne; and so they did, <hi>ut patet, Act.</hi> 4. and 5. and 6. As for the objection of the ruder sort, out of <hi>Matth. 10. 24. The Disciple is not grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then his master;</hi> and so Christ himselfe being poore upon earth, and having not so much as a house to put his head into; the ministers, who are but Christs servants and Disciples, should also be content with the like; it is not worth the answering; Christs speech in that place being meant not of the maintenance, but of the persecution of the Church; unto which as Christ their master, so the Apostles also in their time, and in all ages all his ministers are and have beene subject.</p>
            <p>The second controlment of Gods commandement, concerning the maintenance of the ministery, in distinction. The enviers of the Church maintenance yeeld to the commandement, because they must needs; but they yeeld to the Minister no more then they must needs, and they themselves will be the moderatours of their maintenance. The <hi>non-plus</hi> and stint shall be for food, the keeping of the life and soule together, and for cloathing, the defence of the body from the injury of weather, and araying themselves in rich and fine purple, and faring deliciously every day, <gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#oxf" extent="1 span">

               <pb facs="tcp:173124:140"/> haire, and for his belly, Locusts and wilde hony. If the Minister shall passe this, if it be in apparell, this will cry shame on his pride; if in his diet, fie on his excesse, their owne wardrobes and kitchins passing all fie and shame. In a word, if but a Box of Oyntment shall be poured on the head, though it be of Christ himselfe, they will cry out with <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> the theefe and traitour, <hi>ad quid profusio haec, what needed such wast?</hi> Their owne tables shall abound with the blood of the grape (as the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost speaketh, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 14.) and with the kidneyes of the wheat, the fat of the kidneyes of the wheat; <hi>i.</hi> the finest wheat flower; but the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters dyet, for quality, must be the bread of affliction, <hi>i.</hi> course and unsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorie, and the meate of mourning, as <hi>Osea</hi> speaketh, and for quantitie, his bread by waight, and his water by measure, <hi>ut Ezeck.</hi> 4. 16. If Christ will needs have wine, it shall be <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>
               <hi>mingled with Myrrh, Mark.</hi> 15. 23. and if the Prophets will have potage, death shall bee in the pot, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 4. 40. But it is the Lords pleasure, that not onely it should be <hi>Bethleem,</hi> the house of bread, where Christ should be borne; but that his hill shall be as the hill of <hi>Basan, i.</hi> the hill of fatnesse, <hi>Psal.</hi> 68. for quality, he alloweth unto <hi>Aaron, Num.</hi> 18. 12. the fat of the oyle, the fat of the wine, and the fat of the wheat: and for quantitie, the mansion of the Prophets shall be in <hi>Carmel, i.</hi> a field of plenty, that is, to speake without allegory, that the maintenance of the ministery should be liberall, and their allowance not to bee like to the allowance of the 100. Prophets, whom <hi>Hobadiah</hi> fed with bread and water, but that oyle also be granted to their heads, and their cups overflow.</p>
            <p>The adversaries of this doctrine in the day of the generall doome of the world, shall have the Gentiles themselves, and the heathenising <hi>Israelites</hi> stand up in judgement against them. For the poore widdow of <hi>Sarepta</hi> even in the time of a great famine, gave bread and water to <hi>Elias.</hi> The <hi>Shunammite</hi> builded a chamber for the Prophet, and furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with all other necessaries. In the time of the Anarchie and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordred state of <hi>Israel, Micah, Iud.</hi> 17. bestowed on a <hi>Levite,</hi> beside his bord, and his houseroome, wages and apparell: and idolatrous <hi>Iesa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel</hi> feedeth 400. Prophets at her owne table. In the time of the Law and Leviticall Priesthood, when the Levits were few, and their service but seldome, namely in their courses, their being but onely one place, when they ministred in the Temple of <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> yet their maintenance was great. For which God claimed for his owne tribute, all the tenths of the encrease of the land, beside all the offrings and 48. cities with their suburbs; all these the Lord bestowed on the <hi>Levits</hi> his servants: so that albeit they had no portion in the division of the lands, yet their parts by reason of this was greater, then the part of any one of the 12. Tribs of <hi>Israel.</hi> And therefore now in the time of the Gospell both the places of Gods service, and also the paines, &amp; the number of Gods Ministers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing increased, it is reason their maintenance should be farre greater.</p>
            <p>Those that deny the Minister any more then will serve for his bare necessity, would haply have him both sole and single; sole to live to himselfe onely; and single both in his life and learning. For the one, how can he be harbourous to strangers, liberall to the poore, and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull to others, as they require; if hee have no more then will barely serve his owne uses? And how can he sustaine a familie; that his wife be not left a comfortlesse widdow, and his children helpelesse Orphans,
<pb facs="tcp:173124:141"/> both she and they compelled to crave their food at the doores of the mercilesse, if he have no more than will serve his owne person? And how shall he be able to teach, able to resist the adversary by his skill in the Scriptures, and knowledge in all manner of learning, who scarce having sufficient to feed and cloath himselfe, will hardly finde where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to furnish his studies?</p>
            <p>The second proofe, is the desert of the Minister. Which though to call into question is (as <hi>Aug. Epist. 118.) insolentissima insania,</hi> a most ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapert and presumptuous madnesse, yet it is made a question in these repining dayes. This reason of desert is both in my Text, and also more plainely in the verse following; the labourer is worthy of his wages; and the Oxe that treadeth out the corne deserveth to have his mouth unmuzzled. The Minister is Gods workeman, labouring in the salvation of his peoples soules, his worke calleth for wages from the people, or a woe to the people, <hi>Ier.</hi> 22. 13. The people (saith the Apostle) are Gods husbandrie; the Ministers are both the sowers in the seedetime, and the shearers in the harvest; the crie of their hire, if it be detained will enter into the eares of the Lord, <hi>Iames</hi> 5. 4. The Ministers are lampes; shall the people that sit in darkenesse looke to have them burne, and not finde them oyle? Shall there be Oxen where the cribbe is emptie, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14. or will the Eagles flie thither, where there is no carcase? <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> saith a Rabbin; where there is no flower, <hi>i.</hi> where there is no bread, then there is no law, <hi>i.</hi> as I said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Christ will not be borne but in <hi>Bethlehem, i.</hi> in the house of bread, <hi>i.</hi> the place of maintenance. The Ministers are Christs souldiers, and therefore to be maintained of those for whom they fight. For no man (saith the Apostle) goeth on warfare on his owne charges. They are the Lords Vinedressers, and therefore to eate of the grapes, and to drinke of the wine of the vineyard: they are the Lords Shepheards, and therefore to be fed of the milke of the flocke, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. The Ministers are Christs feete, to carrie the glad tidings of the Gospell, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the example of <hi>Mary</hi> in the Gospell, to be washed, to be dried, yea to be anointed, and to be kissed, <hi>i.</hi> to be maintained, and that libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, and to be honoured.</p>
            <p>The Pleader and Counsellour are counted worthy of their fee; &amp; the Physitian shall receive gifts of the King, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 38. The Ministers are our counsellors in spirituall things, the soliciters and the pleaders of the causes of their people before the Lord: they are the Physitians of our soules; so much more worthy than the other of fee and reward, by how much the possessing of our spirits in peace is more excellent than of our lands &amp; goods, &amp; the health of the soules of men more precious, than of their bodies. To shut up this; there is an excellent place for this, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. Those that sow spirituall things, are richly worthy to reape carnall things. Know ye not, that they which minister about the holy things, doe eate of the things of the Temple: and those that waite at the Altar, are partakers with the Altar? So hath also the Lord ordained, that they which preach the Gospell, should also live of the Gospell. For is it a reasonable thing, that he which feedeth the Congregation with the spirituall diet of the soule, shall in the meane time himselfe be starved for the naturall food of the body? That he which cloatheth the people
<pb facs="tcp:173124:141"/> with the garment of Christs righteousnesse, shall want wherewith to cloath himselfe? that he shall lacke the commodities of this life, by whose meanes, the people have an assurance of the joyes of the other life? I will end this second proofe with that of S. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 4. 4. to him that worketh, the wages is accounted debt and duty.</p>
            <p>The last proofe, is the peoples owne profit, and it is two fold, both in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall and in temporall things. Simonie and Vsurie, two abominations of the Lord, are notwithstanding very lawfull here. For the people maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning him with their temporall things, of whom they receive spirituall things, doe (as it were) buy the holy Ghost for their worldly Mammon, and exchange not (as <hi>Glaucus</hi> and <hi>Diomedes</hi> did) <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

First for spirituall things, the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the ministery, returneth by the preaching of the Word, and the administration of the Sacraments, cōmodities both in number, more, than may easily be reckoned, and in valew greater, than that all the temporall goods of man may countervaile the least. For the Kingdome of heaven, <hi>i.</hi> the Gospell preached is that pretious pearle, which a rich Merchant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could buy it, was faine to sell all that he had. The illumination of our mindes, to know God, to see our owne wickednesse; the grace of the holy Ghost, to behold, to bewaile, to loath, to leave our sinnes, the renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Image of God, our second birth unto righteousnesse and true ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, the comfort of our soules, and peace of our consciences, by assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of forgivenesse of sinnes, and reconcilement with God, faith in a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, hope and expectation to be citizens with the Saints, and of the hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold of God, love of our fellow members in Christ, and a thousand moe like unto these, are the spirituall profits which redound unto the people. The second profit is in temporall things, the eye-marke of the world. Peace and prosperitie are the handmaides of the Gospell, length of dayes are in her right hand, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. and in her left hand riches and honour. The foolish worldling is of <hi>Iudas</hi> opinion; that that which is given to Christ, it is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, it is losse. Whereas indeed that which is allowed to the Minister, is lent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord, and returneth unto the lender his own with advantage: and to bestow liberally on the <hi>Levite,</hi> is not <hi>profundere,</hi> but <hi>serere,</hi> it is not to spend, but to sow, and the seedsman shalbe sure to reape a plentiful harvest, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 13. the gift of the people is with grudging and murmuring, they take them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be undone by their contribution to God and his Priests, and therefore their offerings they are little and naught; but they are accursed, <hi>ver. prox.</hi> In the time of <hi>Hagga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Now I know the Lord will blesse me, because I have intertained a Levite;</hi> and his opinion is true; for he that receiveth an Apostle, receiveth him that sent him, who is Christ himselfe, and if he that giveth unto Christs messenger but a cup of water, shall not lose his reward; the liberall entertainment of Gods Minister how bountifully shall the Lord recompence it.

The poore widow of <hi>Sarepta,</hi> hath but one handfull of meale in a barrell, and a little oyle in a cruse, no more than will serve for once to dresse for her sonne and for her selfe, and then to die; and yet <hi>Elias</hi> must be served first; and the Lord blesseth her meale and her oyle, and it is not a whit lessened for the Prophet, but encreased untill the time of a new supply. For the Lord blesseth the store and the basket of the maintainers of his Ministers, and their liberalitie will turne into their owne bosome. To conclude this, the Ministers maintenance is so farre from impoverishing his people, that he is unto them, as <hi>Iacob</hi> was unto <hi>Laban,</hi> and <hi>Ioseph</hi> unto <hi>Potiphar</hi> and all <hi>Egypt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The contrary to this, is the robbing of the Church, a sinne to common in this age; in which (as it was said in <hi>Neroes</hi> dayes) Parkes are made of Parishes: and not Sparrowes and Swallowes (as in <hi>Davids</hi> time, <hi>Psal.</hi> 84. but Owles, Beasts, and cattell are in Gods house, and men of wealth and of power, instead of being Church pillars, <hi>i.</hi> upholders of Churches and Church-men, are Church-peelers, <hi>i.</hi> robbers of Churches and Churchmen, and whereas the zeale of Gods house should eate them up, <hi>Psal.</hi> 69. their zeale eateth up Gods house; who account it vaine super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluitie for the house of God to be seeled with <hi>Cedar,</hi> or Christs head to be anointed with spikenard.

They are three in number; the first, Gods curse denounced; the second, the person against whom: the third, the reason why, <hi>Woe be to the Shepherd that is an Idoll.</hi> What <hi>woe?</hi> The sword of God upon his arme and upon his eye. What <hi>shepherd?</hi> The priest, prophet, the pastour of Gods people: whom as Christ made his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Fishermen, Men-fishers, <hi>Mark.</hi> 1. 17. so the Lord made them shepherds, not of cattell, but of men. The woe is first in place: but because God doth not execute it, till man doth deserve it, it must bee last in treatise. The person is next, the shepherd, <hi>i.</hi> the minister; the metaphor is knowne, and therefore I passe over it. The reason is last; the trope not so usuall, and the argument fitting our times; and this as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly: and therefore I will stand upon it. <hi>Woe be unto the Idoll Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor.</hi> The consideration of the judgement in the same verse, the withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the arme, and the dimnesse of the eye, expoundeth the double default in the minister, couched in the trope; the one in life, the other in knowledge. For the arme with the hand is the cheefe instrument of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; &amp; the eie the light of the whole body. The shepherd of Gods flock, if his eye be dimme, that hee want knowledge to instruct his sheepe;
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:173124:143"/> and if his arme be lame, that his owne practise shall not direct his flocke in the wayes of God: then what doth he differ from the Idols in the <hi>Psalme,</hi> that have eyes, but see not, hands and armes, but use them not? and therefore such a pastour worthily termed, an idoll shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd.

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. I will speake of them severally and briefly.</p>
            <p>First for the eye; the theme is ample, but I must be short; I will therefore reduce it unto three respects; the quality of the calling; the weakenesse of the people: and the strength of the adversary.</p>
            <p>For the first: <hi>Plato</hi> writeth that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> chose alwayes their Priests out of the Colledges of Philosophers. The high Priest in the old Law, wore <hi>Vrim</hi> on his brest, and <hi>Bels</hi> on his skirts; light signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the one, and sound by the other. <hi>The light of the body is the eye; and if the eye be darke</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>how great is that darknesse?</hi> The light of the soule is the understanding, the light of the understanding is knowledge; and where it is wanting, what is there else, but a foggie and palpable mist, nay a totall eclipse of all reason and judgement? The sound of the bells is the preaching voyce of the minister; who if hee be empty, the sound is hollow, and himselfe no better then <hi>sounding brasse, or a trinkling Cimball;</hi> and as the <hi>Lacedaemonian</hi> said of the Nightingale, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, nothing but a voyce. The Minister is the interpreter of the Law, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. 52. how shall he interpret that hee understandeth not? and himselfe wanting the key of knowledge, how shall hee open to others the kingdome of Christ? The Prophet is both <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> a <hi>seer</hi> and <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> a <hi>cryer, Esa.</hi> 40. 3. but a seer first, as good hee
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:173124:143"/> want his tongue to cry▪ as his eye to see. God hath set him as a watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the Towre of his Church, <hi>Ez<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>.</hi> 3. and it is no office for a blinde man. Nay though he have an eye, if it be dimme; hee will not serve for such a place. For hee standeth on high to looke a far off, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore must not bee like the seer in the Gospel, that could not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scerne betweene a man and a tree, <hi>Marke.</hi> 8. 24. A great part of the ministery in this land, is either stone▪ blind, or sand-blind; either bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles and moles, quite without sight, or tender-eyed owles, seeing onely in the dark; either utterly voyd of all manner of learning, or having one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a little twilight of knowledge. The two Vniversities, the very eyes of the Realme, as sometime <hi>Demosthenes</hi> called <hi>Athens,</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the eye of <hi>Greece,</hi> being so well able to furnish Gods flocke with see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing shepherds▪ our Church is little beholding to her patrons for prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to the regiment of her flocke so many unlettered and unsufficient Priests, either Idolls or Idolls fellowes; whose eyes have either a filme growne over them, that they see nothing, or a pinne and webbe in them that they see but little. And these are the men, whose tongues fierie indeed, like the Apostles <hi>Act.</hi> 2. but not cloven; that is, zealous but not learned, preach against learning, pull downe the prelacie to reare up a presbytery, bray forth intemperate censures against the lawfull ceremonies of our Church, as being superstitious, and the dregs and reliques of popery; the kneeling at the Sacrament, the repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of certaine prayers in our Liturgie, the singing of Service and the sound of the organ in Colledges and Collegiat Churches, the square Cap and surplisse, the painted windowes, marrying with the Ring, and Christnings with the crosse and such like; in some of which, were our Prelates as couragious, as our puritans are presumptious; they would be either enforced to order, or turned out of orders. The office of the minister, it is to teach; Saint <hi>Paul</hi> will have him <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: and can he teach others, who himselfe is untaught? Shall he bee <hi>prius imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torum magister, quàm doctorum discipulus, Hieron.</hi> a master to the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, before he be scholler to the learned. Preaching is the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest practise of Gods prophet; but <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

The Arke indeede was drawne by Oxen▪ 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 6. but not without both danger to it selfe, by the stumbling of the beasts, and death unto <hi>Huzzah</hi> in staying the carte. And let not the Patrons of Church livings thinke Oxen and Asses fit to bee imployed about Gods Arke his Church. To shut up this first respect; the Preachers are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Angels of the Churches, <hi>Apoc. 1. ult.</hi> and Angels are called <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, of their manifold knowledge. Their duty is to minister a word in time, and must therefore have the tongues of the learned, <hi>Esay</hi> 50. they are physitians, and must therefore have skill, <hi>Ier. 8. ult.</hi> they are the oracles of the people, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 7. and must therefore be able to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer all questions. And therefore as <hi>Herodotus</hi> writeth, that <hi>Croesus</hi> sonne speaking, and being but an infant, was divined to signifie the fall
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:173124:144"/> of his Fathers house and Kingdome: so the people to have infant-prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers to speake among them, pulleth downe Gods house and Christs Kingdome.</p>
            <p>For the other two, I will speake but a word of each. The one is the weakenesse of the people. Christianity <hi>peregrinatio est, militia est,</hi> it is a waifaring, it is a warfaring: the Minister <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> a guide and <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> a captaine. The people are as straying sheepe▪ their home is Heaven; they knowing not the way; if the shepherd be an idoll, and cannot guide them; Sathan as a Wolfe and a Lion, commeth roaring between them and home, and carrieth both Pastour and People for a prey to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unto his denne. The People are as new pressed souldiers; ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of all the feates of spirituall warre. If the Preacher, as their Captaine, cannot traine them, and teach them the use of their wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, both defensive, the <hi>helmet of Salvation,</hi> and <hi>the sheild of Faith, Ephes.</hi> 6. 16. and offensive, <hi>the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God;</hi> and acquaint them with the stratagems of the enemy; I cannot stand to follow the allegory; the fiery darts of the adversary being not quenched, the Dragon and his Angels will prevaile over them. The people are blind, they must have a leader, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. they are in darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, the Preacher must be their light: they want discretion, they must have <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> an instructer: they are unlearned, and must have <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> a teacher. The Church is a field, the Ministers are clouds, the preaching of the word, is the watering of the ground with the dew, with the raine. If the clouds shall be <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Iude</hi> 12. the soile must needs be barren. To end this, if the shepherd shall be an idoll, then the heathen saying shall be true, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and Christs saying shall be false, <hi>the Disciple is not above his Master.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third and last respect is the strength of the adversary. The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is <hi>Gods building, 1 Cor.</hi> 3. 9. the adversary both spirituall and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall is as ready to pull downe, as the minister to set up: and so the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher must be like the builders in the fourth of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> 17. their worke in one hand, and a sword in the other. The spirituall enemy, Sathan, is an ancient and subtill sophister, and will prevaile in his temptations, if the preacher be not able to find out his <hi>Elenches.</hi> The carnall enemy the Papist, he careth not for <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza;</hi> he hath made himselfe strong with the arts, with the tongues, with the fathers, with the schoolemen, with all sorts of learning; and the Minister that is to stand against all assaults, must be able to entertaine every enemy in his owne kinde; least while the invader be stronger in assault, then the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in resistance, the people be forced to yeeld themselves, and to turne from truth unto heresie.</p>
            <p>Thus much shall suffice for the shepherds eye. I come now unto his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> arme. It behooveth the Preacher to be, as <hi>Achilles</hi> Father would have his Sonne, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Hee that will be, as the people esteemed <hi>Iohn Baptist, Mar.</hi> 11. 32. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, a Prophet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, must be <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap> as well <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as was Christ himselfe the chiefe shepherd of the sheepe. Our sense is soone deceived. <hi>Thomas</hi> would not beleeve that he heard, till he saw that he doubted of. Let the life of the Minister so jumpe with his learning that the people may say,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:173124:144"/> as the <hi>Psalmist</hi> doth, <hi>Psalme 48. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> as we have heard, so we have seene.</hi> His conversation must so exemplifie his doctrine, that according to the phrase of the Spirit, <hi>Exo.</hi> 20. 18. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the people may see the preachers voice. This argument also is long, and I must be short, and therefore I will draw it into foure heads or regards; the first of God, the second of their ministery; the third of the people, and the fourth of themselves.</p>
            <p>For the first. No <hi>Levite</hi> that had any kind of blemish might come neere the Lords Altar <hi>Levit.</hi> 21. [The shadow in a type hath a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable truth in the body,] The blemishes in the bodies of the Priests under the law, were figures of the sinnes in the soules of the Ministers under the Gospell; and as God remooved them from mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string at his Altar, so he repelleth these from preaching his word, <hi>Psal. 50. 16. What hast thou to doe to Preach mine ordinance, &amp;c.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the <hi>Levite</hi> must be <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               <hi>without blemish,</hi> as being Gods Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour; so the Preacher must be <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, they must be sanctified. Their ministry is in <hi>Bethel. i.</hi> in Gods house. The hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then were wont to write over the dores of their temples, <hi>Phanum est, ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil ingrediatur prophanum.</hi> To reare up spirituall idols in <hi>Bethel; to make</hi> (as Christ speaketh) <hi>his Fathers house a den of theeves;</hi> to turne <hi>Bethel,</hi> the house of God, into <hi>Bethaven,</hi> the house of wickednes, it is a <hi>Ieroboams</hi> sin: <hi>Gilead</hi> a City of the Prophets, to be a city of wickednes, <hi>Hosea</hi> 6. and <hi>Ierusalem</hi> the valley of vision, to become the valley of <hi>Benhinnom,</hi> the valley of loathsomenesse, it cannot scape the burthen of the Lord. And it will grow into a scorne and a byword, <hi>Etiam Saul inter prophetas;</hi> if a wicked man shall be among Gods Prophets.</p>
            <p>For the second. The Ministers are the bearers of the Lords vessels, and must therefore be cleane, <hi>Esa.</hi> 52. For the Pharisees, whose righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse we must exceed, if we will enter into the Kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, had this regard, not to touch their meats and drinke, which are Gods gifts, with common and unwasht hands. The Lords materiall vessels, the vessels of the sanctuary, they were holy, <hi>ut supra:</hi> his
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:173124:145"/> spirituall vessels, his word and sacraments, are much more holy: and those that beare them before the people, must be sanctified. Otherwise though man hath called them, yet the spirit hath not called them: they are intruders and usurpers for all the Bishops orders: because Christ the Bishop of our soules hath not ordained them: neither is it lawfuller for them to meddle with Gods vessels, then it was for King <hi>Vzziah</hi> to burne incense on the Altar, and was smitten with leprosie for his presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

Preisthood and prophesie, though in former ages distinct functions, doe now both concurre in the Minister, and therefore he must be a double <hi>Nazarite,</hi> abstaining from all spirituall drunkennesse of sinne, and restrayning all the whorish lusts of the flesh. And seeing his heart must be the storehouse of the word, and his lips the deliverers of the law; neither may the one, nor the other be uncircumcised; but wickednesse and corruption, as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane foreskinne, must be cut from them both, lest by their filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse he pollute those things which God hath purified.

            <p>For the third; the Pastors of Gods Church ought to be ensamples unto Christs flocke, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. And though it be truely said, <hi>vivimus le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibus non exemplis,</hi> and Christ biddeth the people to doe as the phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees say, not as they doe; yet the most part of men are of the <hi>Civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> opinion, <hi>Quod exemplo fit, jure fieri videtur,</hi> example is a kind of warrant. <hi>Suadet loguentis vita non oratio,</hi> saith the poet, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

For the one, the minister, as he is Christs Disciple, so he should be his follower; prooving those things by his life, which he preacheth by his doctrine; that he may say unto the people, as Christ doth, not onely, <hi>Praeceptum do vobis, Iohn,</hi> 13. 34. but also <hi>exemplum dedi vobis, ibid. ver.</hi> 15.

The Preachers are the Lords builders, and the people are the building, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 9. unlesse the life of the minister, doe edifie as well as his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, if he build up heaven with his voyce, and hell with his life, saith <hi>Nazianzen;</hi> he is an evill builder, and plucketh downe as much with the one hand, as he setteth up with the other. Nay he shall not convict so many with an hundred of his Sermons, as he shall pervert with one of his wicked actions. It is the dishonour of the wicked man, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6. 13. but it will be his honour to speake with his feete, and to teach with his fingers. <hi>i.</hi> to walke and to doe according to his owne doctrine, <hi>Secerdotis os, mens, manusque concordent. Hier. ad Nepotianum.</hi> To be short, if when the doctrine is <hi>mel,</hi> the life shall be <hi>venenum, Bern.</hi> He envenometh the people with his example; and that is an other <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboams</hi> sinne, <hi>To make Israel to sinne.</hi> For the other; the evill life of the Minister is the dishonour of God, and the disgrace of his Ministerie. For as at the sight of good workes in the Preachers, the people doe glorifie their Father which is in heaven: so contrariwise at the view of their wicked lives, they will speake evill of the Gospell, and suspect Religion to be but policie to keepe men in awe; as being perswaded, that if their doctrine were true, they would not themselves controll it by their owne practise, and therefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> is earnest in this point, <hi>Rom. 2. 21. Thou that teachest another, teachest thou not thy selfe, &amp;c. 1 Sam.</hi> 2. There is an example; the <hi>Israelites</hi> abhorre the offerings of the Lord, through the sinnes of the Priests, the sonnes of <hi>Ely.</hi> And such a Minister may looke for at the mouthes of the people the checke in the Proverbe, <hi>Loripedem rectus,</hi> and that which is, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9. 34. Thou that art altogether a sinner, teachest thou us. As it was objected unto <hi>Plato, Aliter loqueris, aliter vivis,</hi> so it will be unto him. <hi>Quid verba audiam, cum facta videam,</hi> what should wee heed what thou preachest, when we see how thou livest?</p>
            <p>The fourth and last respect is of themselves. The Minister, whom nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the regard of God, whose messenger he is, neither the holinesse of his function, neither the offence of the people will move to godlinesse of life, may happly be moved by that argument, by which all men are moved, the consideration of his owne private good. For commonly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men, when no place either of <hi>Logicke</hi> or <hi>Rhetorick</hi> will perswade; yet the reason drawne from <hi>Lucrum &amp; damnum</hi> will not faile. Now the losse is of the two greatest things that man hath, the losse of his name, and the losse of his soule. For the one, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap> saith the wise <hi>Ecclesiastes, A good name, &amp;c.</hi> For the other the soule is valued at the worth of the whole world, <hi>Math.</hi> 16. 26. and the priser is he, who having ransomed so many, can best tell the valew. For the first losse; the Preacher that inveigheth against sins, whereof himselfe is guiltie, fometh out his owne shame, <hi>Iude ver.</hi> 13. and the shame is both unexcusable, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 1. and unavoidable, <hi>Matth. 5. For he is as a citie set on a hill, and can not be hidde;</hi> the eyes and eares of his people are both duly and daily observers of his life; and though the <hi>Poet</hi> say of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, of private life, <hi>Benè qui latuit, benè vixit,</hi> close keeping cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:173124:146"/> a multitude of sinnes; yet the Minister, as his life can not be secret, so his shame can not be hid. For the second losse. Shall hee, saith <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard,</hi> that taketh the charge of other mens soules, neglect the charge of his owne? For what is the boxe the better for the sweet ointment, or the loose liver for the prerogative of his Ministerie? It doth not van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage <hi>Balaam</hi> to be a Prophet, if he will love the wages of unrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. It will not boot <hi>Iudas</hi> to be Christs disciple? if he betray him. In the day of the generall assise of the world; the prophesying in Christs name will not serve for an answer, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. but there shall be a replie and a sentence together; <hi>Depart from me, &amp;c.</hi> For God shall not judge after the doctrine, but after the life of the Minister; and every man shall receive according to his workes. That which the <hi>Iewes</hi> spake falsely of Christ, is verified of these men, that though they save others, yet themselves they can not save.

               </gap> that denounceth Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on those sinnes, which himselfe committeth, is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

<pb n="258" facs="tcp:173124:147"/> and Order</hi> first, being the last words of my Text? I hope, I shall not.

Shall I take them both together? thats against order too. Distinct subjects would be handled severally. But shall I sever sisters? They are <hi>Individuae,</hi> not <hi>Comites,</hi> but <hi>Charites,</hi> inseparable graces, both bred from above. <hi>Species &amp; ordo à Deo,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> Gods daughters both.

Looke both on heaven and earth: see Comlinesse in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricke, and Order in their site. Yea both in every creature. How glorious are the Angells? And there are Orders of them too. Starres have their lustre, and their severall spheres. Nay Gods selfe, the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour is heautifull in both. <hi>Decorem induit, David</hi> saith, <hi>Psal.</hi> 92. Hee is clad with comlinesse, for his substance; and there is Order in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. Though none be after, or afore an other, greater or lesse than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; yet is the Second, Sonne unto the First, and the Third proceeds from both. Nor are these graces, heavens Prerogative: the smallest and vilest creature hath them both. And for man; Kings in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, Bishops in the Church, require them both. Their selves consist, both Scepter and Miter are preserv'd by them. Statutes and Constitutions, both Clergie Lawes, and Lay, looke all at them, looke at them both. Nor looke at them alone, bid onely with <hi>Paul</hi> here, <hi>Fiat, let it be:</hi> but also, <hi>that</hi> it be. Iudges and Iustices by Inquests, Bishops and Archdeacons by Enquiries are continually sollicitous, that all things be done every where Decently, and in Order.</p>
            <p>Must I yet needs sever them for Order sake? First then for <hi>Comli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi> by it selfe, lay the <hi>Fiat</hi> to it first. The Church is the Sanctuary, that is, the holy place. There ought indeed be comlinesse in all places. But in the house of Prayer, hallowed for sacred uses, it ought to be especially. [<hi>Moses,</hi> an holy person, must not stand shodd on holy ground] Let all things be decent in the Church, if but for the place sake; it is the Sanctuary. It should be <hi>Schola Decori Clem. Rom. lib. 8. c.</hi> 31. The Priests deportment decent there; the same gesture becomes not the Pulpit, and the Stage: and the peoples demeanor decent too; <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, <hi>Chrysost.</hi> They are not so to come to the Church, as to a Play-house. The businesse there is holy: and as <hi>Moses</hi> bad in civill things, <hi>Exequere Iustum justè,</hi> Execute Iustice justly; so in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly businesse, <hi>Quod sanctum est, sanctè peragatur,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Ambrose,</hi> Let holy things be done holily. Christ expelled the prophane people out of the holy place. His ground was, that the Temple was called the House of Prayer.</p>
            <p>Nor the House of Prayer onely; so were many among the Heathens.
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:173124:147"/> Their Idolls had their Oratories. But our Temples are Gods House. <hi>Phanum est;</hi> was written over the porches of their Temples, Much more it should be over ours, <hi>Phanum est; nihil ingrediatur Prophanum;</hi> this is an hallowed place; come no prophane thing here.

            <p>Nor is it Gods House onely. Many have houses which they dwell not in; but onely retire to them sometimes for ease. But the Church is Gods Mansion, the place of his Residence, his personall Presence. But in the Presence▪ Chamber of a King, what care is there, all things be comely. No subject must be covered there. The Church is more, more than the presence: God is there in Person. A right <hi>Bethel,</hi> as <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> called the place of his Vision.

            <p>Were it but for the Angells onely, twere argument enough. They are present there. And tis Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> owne Reason, that womens heads be covered, <hi>Propter▪ Angelos,</hi> because of the Angells. They are pure spirits; doe no impure thing before them. Nay were it but for our brethren sakes, Saints on earth. Let every man reverence his brother, as Gods Saint. He ought in charitie to hold him so.

               </gap>, the Schoole of Order. <hi>Clemens</hi> saith out of the Apostles Constitutions. There would be no tumult, no confusion there.</p>
            <p>To end this first part; that both Priest and people follow Saint <hi>Pauls Fiat</hi> in both these Requisites; the Church hath invested the Bishop with authoritie, to see to the performance. Not the Bishop onely, but the Archdeacon too; Seers both, eyes both; Archdeacon the Bishops eye, so called in <hi>Canon</hi> Law, and the Bishop Gods eye. An argument of the great necessitie of the duties, which needed so many eyes to see them done. The Priest himselfe, every private Minister a Seer too. <hi>Seer, what seest thou?</hi> saith God to the Prophet. But because he is a
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:173124:148"/> partie, lest hee should oversee; the Church hath charged others to oversee the Priest; especially the Bishop; who hath his name of it, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, a Bishop, that is, an Overseer. Tis time wee leave the <hi>Quid,</hi> what duty <hi>Paul</hi> craves of us; and come to the <hi>In quo,</hi> wherein hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth it.</p>
            <p>The object is <hi>Omnia, Let all things,</hi> saith the Apostle. An object in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> if left loose to it selfe. For <hi>what</hi> thing is not in <hi>all</hi> things? Yea confind to the Requisites, tis too ample still. The rule runnes out, and reaches to all actions in the world. But the Apostle meant it but a Church-Canon here; and tis large enough so too. By your reverend leaves, I will bind it to those bounds, Church-actions onely, and but some few of those.</p>

            <p>The Swenkfeldians and the Anabaptists, some Brownists, all En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiasts pretend an inward calling by the spirit. But they know not, by what spirit. The spirit of pride some; the spirit of giddinesse more; the spirit of Sathan all. <hi>Calvin</hi> saith, <hi>Nemo sobrius,</hi> to Gods ministery none well in his wits, but will be cald by mans ministery, <hi>Instit.</hi> 4. 3. §. 14.

For me to rush rashly into <hi>Moses</hi> chaire, from the shuttle, from the Last upon conceipt, I understand the word, is profane presumption, but usuall with Anabaptists.</p>
            <p>What had <hi>Micahs</hi> sonne to doe with an <hi>Ephod,</hi> and a <hi>Teraphim,</hi> an <hi>Ephraimites</hi> sonne? <hi>In diebus illis,</hi> saith the Scripture there, <hi>there was no King in Israel in those dayes.</hi> In <hi>Ieroboams</hi> dayes too, whosoever would might consecrate himselfe; there was a King then, but a bad King in <hi>Israel. Paul</hi> saith, no man assumed the honour of priesthood, Leviticall priesthood except he were cald. The Evangelicall is more honorable: tis great boldnesse without calling, to presume to assume it; to be (as <hi>Basil</hi> termes it) <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

            <p>Let me not teach Heresie, let me not teach Schisme; but let me be admonisht by those whom it concernes.

If I will not say, my Saviour suffered for my sinnes, all that I should have suffered, Hell, as well as death, <hi>diros cruciatus,</hi> the utter torments of a damned man, the essentiall paines of Hell, w<seg rend="sup">ch</seg> two famous papists adventured first to say: shall itch of oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, make towne and country ring of it? this is not <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, tumult and disorder. Christ suffered, what was fit for him, fit for Gods Sonne, Gods selfe: torments in his body, sorrowes in his soule, bitter paines in both. What they were in body, Gods booke expresseth them; but what in soule, who dares determine? I dare not. In matters of such nature I will not fetch my phrase from men. Neither <hi>Austin,</hi> or <hi>Calvin,</hi> new nor old must bid me speake what Scripture warrants not. I will take my termes from it; from the Prophets, from the Apostles, they spake by the spirit; from Christs selfe; hee best knew, what hee payed for us.</p>
            <p>Here I humbly pray the pardon of mine honorable Ordinarie; Even this may seeme unseemely, to have instanced in this, in a case concernes my selfe. Let Saint <hi>Ierom</hi> bee mine advocate; <hi>in suspicione Haereseos,</hi> in the charge of Heresie, in the chalenge of false doctrine, publickly
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:173124:150"/> and often, noe man ought bee patient, nor doe I breake (I hope) the <hi>Canon,</hi> which forbiddeth opposition. I oppose not others doctrine, I but maintaine mine owne. Which (if popish) my selfe will curse it unto hell; if sound, why should I betray it by my silence? while I doe not second contradicted truthe, I seeme to towne and country to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse I have taught errour? <hi>Precatio &amp; Praedicatio,</hi> Prayer and Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, holy actions both, and sisters in Gods service, are in some assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies fallen into emulation: strive not for precedence; Preaching is content to let prayer goe before; shee is her elder. But shee shoves, and shoulders her, gives her little roome; would make her (if shee might) <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, thrust her quite out of the Church. Might some Preachers have their wills; there would be no praying, but onely in the Pulpit; as if the Ministers pew were a peece of popery. They will preach <hi>ad Clepsydram,</hi> two or three houres together: but divine service they will clip and dismember. And that little which they reade, they will huddle and post too, as if prayer were profane, and devotion superstition. Surely this unseemelinesse is profanenesse in the Priest, and deads devotion in the people.</p>
            <p>What if I list not to Christen with the Crosse? I will then use the words, but I will not make the signe. And yet I will say, if I be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd, that I sign'd the Infant with the Crosse. But Iesuite-like, I will equivocate. I sign'd it with the Crosse, that is, I gave it baptisme, which is the signe and figure of the Crosse; for <hi>Baptisma Crux est,</hi> saith <hi>Chrysostome, Aug. tom. 7. col. 952. D.</hi> Or, if needs I must deale plainely; I will bid a <hi>Psalme</hi> bee sung, to draw away the eares and the eyes of the assembly. So farre, as I can possibly, they shall neither see me doe the thing, nor heare mee say the words. To sing <hi>Psalmes,</hi> is religious. But when the people should attend the instant action, to pray for the child baptized, and to give thankes for it; it is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

            <p>To sit at the Communion, two or three wilfull Refractaries to sit alone, when others, when all others kneele, is unseemely, because singular: for that; but not for that alone.

Gods maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie, from whom by the hands of the Minister hee receives the myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, impiously contemned, the mysteries themselves vilipended, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie resisted, and the brethren offended, upon a foolish feare of worshiping the Elements. Which neither (I dare say) they thinke
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:173124:150"/> their brethren doe, albeit they kneele; nor would others thinke they did, if they kneeled too. They may not kneele, because the Papists doe. Weake men! how many things doe they, which Papists doe? They might kneele as they doe; and yet not worship as they doe. Tis partly too in fond conceit, it is a Supper: men sit at supper, they kneele not. Poore reasons! It is marvell they will take it in the morning, men use not to suppe then; and Christ ministred it at night. It is marvell they will take it in the Church; Christ did it in the house: and not sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting neither, by their leaves, because they bee so strickt; the Iewes position of body at meales was not like ours. But I dispute not the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion: onely I except against the action for uncomelinesse.</p>
            <p>To conclude, <hi>Quod Histrio in Scena,</hi> what the Player observeth on the Stage, tis absurd, a wise man should not in his life, the Oratour saith: More absurd a Christian should not in the Church, <hi>Decorum,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie and order all actions.

Execute Iustice, Iustly.</hi> You give a charge to the Inquest; this is Gods charge to you. By his assistance, with your reverend patience, briefly of each in order.</p>
            <p>The Act is excellent: <hi>Execution</hi> in Policy,<note place="margin">α.</note> like <hi>Elocution</hi> in Oratory, <hi>primum, secundum, tertium,</hi> the prime, and the maine, and the All in All of it. Not <hi>Dilige Iustitiam,</hi> as the wise man bids, to <hi>Love Iudgement:</hi> not <hi>Scire,</hi> to know it, as the Prophet bids. They are but Contemplation and Affection; to Love and Study it, belongs to all. But the Iudge and Magistrate must doe more: God bids them <hi>Exequi; Action</hi> is craved of them; they must <hi>Execute Iustice:</hi> that is, must see the Lawes obeyed; must censure those, who either doe not, what Iustice bids, or doe, what it forbids. [God bids in <hi>Esay, Keepe Iudgement, and Execute it:</hi> not keepe it as a Prisoner, and Execute it, as a Malefactour: But to <hi>Keepe Iudgement,</hi> is to performe it; and <hi>to Execute</hi> it, is to administer it.] It is not <hi>Quaerere, to seeke it,</hi>
               <pb n="267" facs="tcp:173124:151"/> as <hi>Esay</hi> bids; and yet there is action in that too: but that is the Iurours office, as well as the Iudges to enquire after it. But you the Iudges are they that must Execute Iustice. For what bootes their or your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition without your Execution? The <hi>Rabbines</hi> have a saying, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Transgressours neede a Session house. The Lawes suffice them not; there must be Iudges to execute the Lawes.</p>
            <p>Bad manners occasion the making of good Lawes; but good Lawes occasion the encreasing of bad manners. <hi>Nitimur in Vetitum.</hi> The lists of Law encrease the lusts of men: that unlesse Iustice doe inflict the paine, as well as Wisdome did enact the Law, vice growes the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by prohibition: and (as (<hi>Paul</hi> speakes in another sense) sinne by the Law growes out of measure sinnefull. Where there wants execution, there wants not transgression, impunity encourages to al licentiousnesse; not to light slippes onely, but to grosse enormities. Indulgence breeds not onely negligence; but is (as <hi>Bernard</hi> stiles it) the mother of inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, the nurse of impudency. Onely execution is the Lawes life; so severe among the <hi>Spartanes,</hi> that neither their chests had lockes, nor their doores bolts. The Law without the Iudge is but a dead let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. It takes the life from him; who is therefore called by the Greeke Philosopher <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

Rape, Robbery, Idolatry, were rife sometimes in <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael:</hi> but when, <hi>Non erat Rex, there was no King in Israel,</hi> no Iudge for execution. The awe of the Law is small, where is no Magistrate. And where one is, it is not great, if he censure not offendours. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>he carries not the sword for nought.</hi> Surely he does, if he execute not Iustice. The Libertine will say, either tis a sheath without a sword; or the sword is rusted in the sheath. He will breake the Law boldly; for he never sees it drawne. There was a Law in <hi>Rhodes,</hi> that none should shave their beards; and yet scarse in all the Iland should you meete a man unshaven. As there is a Law with us, that no man should be drunke; yet who almost amongst us, but is sometimes scarce sober? Why? but because the Magistrates, both theirs and ours execute not the Law.</p>
            <p>God hath wild equity and Iustice to his people. For his Word is his Will: call we it not his Testament? The Law is Gods Legacy; and he hath made the Magistrate his Executour. And as the order is in Probates of Willes, he hath sworne him also to performance. And is he not titled by his office too, Iudge, or Iustice, or the like? <hi>Nomen inane, crimen immane,</hi> a vaine <hi>name,</hi> is a maine shame. But an Oath is an argument, should urge more strongly. [The other an inducement; but it an inforcement to execution.] The growth of all ungracious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse occasioned by impunity, a stronger reason yet. For the sinnes of the people, caused by his Connivence, God will punish on his Soule.</p>
            <p>He that hath an Office, the Apostle bids him waite on it. It is a shame, that <hi>Gallio,</hi> an officer of Peace, Lord chiefe Iustice of it, shall see breach of Peace, a man beaten in the streets, even before his face, and care not. The Woman said boldly to <hi>Philip,</hi> King of <hi>Macedon,</hi>
               <pb n="268" facs="tcp:173124:152"/> when she beseeching him to right her wrong, he answered, he would not, <hi>Noli ergo regnare,</hi> why, then be not a King. So did another to <hi>Hadrian</hi> the Emperour, <hi>Noli igitur imperare. Spartian.</hi> Wilt thou not doe justice? why then be not a judge.</p>
            <p>There are three Obstacles to execution. Feare, Favour, Bribes. The Iudge hath an eye, to see a sinne, and a hand to smite the sinner. But he is sometimes <hi>Excors,</hi> he wants a heart. The offender, either is great himselfe, or hath some great maintainer. He dares not execute. As sometimes the Sergeant dares not arrest, for feare of blood; so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Iudge also dares not arraigne for feare of anger.

Nay Gods selfe forbids a Iudge to <hi>feare,</hi> to feare <hi>the face of man;</hi> because the Throne is Gods. <hi>Fiat Iustitia, &amp; ruat Mundus,</hi> Doe justice, doe it with a sound heart; let the world fall on thee, it will not bruise thee.</p>
            <p>Favour is worse then Feare, Affection a slow hastener of Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The Delinquent is my servant, my friend, my kinsman; shall I censure him? Muse not at the slacke execution of the Lawes; for who is not almost one of these to some Commissioner. There is a vice, a weed runnes over all the world, Mother to many sinnes, Saint <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome</hi> saith to all: Non-execution of the Law is the cause it is so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. But the cause of this cause, is this evill-favoured favour. Hee, upon whose knees the devill beares this brat, hath beene my servant. After he hath haply served me many yeares, I reward him with a license to set up a signe, a signe of drunkennesse, of unthriftinesse, of want on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, of prophanenesse, of all leudnesse. Which seeing I shall see, but I will not perceive, and hearing I shall heare, but I will not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand; because he is my Servant. Nay say, he be anothers, and not mine; yet I will heare and see, but will say nothing. My Fellow in Commission hath authorised him. <hi>Iudge not, and you shall not be judged:</hi> I must show his servant favour, that mine may find the like. I instance but in this; I wish I might not in some more. How will I winke at the trespasse of the Lawes in my deare friend, or my neere kinsman, if I will not see my servant? How will I be starke blind, if my sonne shall be a trespasser?</p>
            <p>Heathens have not stumbled at greater stones, then these. <hi>Torqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> a <hi>Romane,</hi> and <hi>Zaleucus,</hi> a <hi>Grecian</hi> spared not to sentence even their owne sonnes. <hi>Amicus Plato, magis amica veritas.</hi> My dearest friend, my neerest kinsman, are not so deare, or neere to me, as justice,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:173124:152"/> as my Countrey, as my King. I owe my kinsman, and my friend my love: but I owe Love and Loyaltie, and Allegeance unto these. Let the Christian Magistrate heare the Hethven Oratour, <hi>Exuat personam Iudicis qui induit amici;</hi> the affection of a friend, fits not the function of a Iudge; He must say with <hi>Levi,</hi> to his brethren, to his parents, yea even unto his children, <hi>Nescio vos, I know him not, Deut.</hi> 33.</p>
            <p>Favour was worse than feare; but bribes are worse than both. They <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> worke the <hi>Occoecation</hi> of the Iudge, not the execution of the Law. Love bleares his eyes, but gifts quite blind them. Be the offender nere so vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible; he sees him not. He must be very grosse, his fault must be felt, be palpable, ere hee will know it. Nay the more palpable, the lesse culpable. God hath given him a sword; but a bribe hath turned the edge. The Law bids him strike; but a gift, like a Gout, is in his hand. Or lest he say happly, he is a Commissioner, not an Executioner; Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice bids him, but speake, but sentence sinne. But <hi>Bos in lingua,</hi> the Palsie too is in his tongue. <hi>Sirackes</hi> sonne saith, bribes strike dumbe, as well as blind, 20. 28.</p>
            <p>Feare and favour, were charmes both, but the charmes of flesh <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">

               </gap> bloud. But a bribe is a spell, a spell from hell; it binds faster than they both. Resolution happly conquers Feare, and Religion often masters Love. But filthy lucre, not Right, not Reason, not Reputation, not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion can loosen it. <hi>Prosopoleptes,</hi> an accepter of persons will sometimes doe justice. Affection will be check't. But <hi>Doroleptes,</hi> an accepter of gifts, will nere doe Iustice. Corruption will not yeeld. The gift is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: shall he censure the Delinquent notwithstanding? Then hee will challenge him, and shame him at the barre. Shall he returne it? There is shame in that too; and it will be blaz'd hee had it once. And hardly will one part from a thing, he once possesseth. Sathan in his heart is seased of it; his clawes hold fast. And where he is, hell is; for it is his Court, <hi>Et ab inferis nulla redemptio,</hi> and nothing comes ever backe from hell. Take heede of gifts all Iudges. They are called blessings in the Scripture phrase; but the Scripture curseth them unto the Iudge. The gifts a curse unto the Iudge, and the Iudge a curse unto his countrie. Iudgement maintaines it, but <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

            </p>
            <p>To end this first point of my Text; Mildnesse in a Magistrate, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlenesse in a Iudge, as hee is a Iudge, are faults, not commendations. Who should be more indulgent, then parents? Tis their Attribute. Yet <hi>Cyprian</hi> saith, children at the day of Iudgement shall crie out of them, <hi>Parentes sensimus parricidas,</hi> our cockerers have beene our Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers; their winking at our sinnes, was the damning of our soules. The remisse Magistrate, <hi>Parcendo saevit,</hi> as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith of God; his Clemencie is crueltie. Whose sinnes he spares, their soules he spilles; his humanitie is immanity. I mention not the mischiefe which comes by this remissenesse to the common wealth. Where transgressours are not censur'd, who can be secure, in name, in goods, or life. It is a true sentence which is written in the Guild Hall of this citie, even in the Iudges eye, <hi>Qui parcit malis laedit bonos,</hi> he that spares the evill wrongs the good.</p>
            <pb n="270" facs="tcp:173124:153"/>
            <p>The next point is the Object of this Execution, it is <hi>Justice,</hi> or <hi>Right.</hi> God, as he hath defin'd the Iudges act; it was to <hi>execute:</hi> so he hath confin'd him to his Object, it must be <hi>Right.</hi> Not <hi>Legitimum,</hi> but <hi>Iustum,</hi> not <hi>Law,</hi> but <hi>Iustice.</hi> A law may be unjust: that the Iudge may not execute. <hi>Ius Fori, &amp; Ius Poli</hi> doe not alwayes jumpe. <hi>Caesar</hi> (saith Saint <hi>Hierom</hi>) speakes sometimes crosse to Christ, and <hi>Papinian</hi> to <hi>Paul.</hi> Our <hi>Caesar</hi> hath religiously advised in such case, utterly to abdicate the office of a Iudge, rather than desperately to damne the soule. It is not <hi>Ius;</hi> but <hi>Iustum,</hi> which the Iudge must execute, not Law, but Right, <hi>Exequere justum justè.</hi> A Law may be unjust and irreligious. Our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have seene such. God bids the Iudge to execute, not persecute. For so is the sentence, when the Law is wicked, meere Persecution.</p>

               </gap>, justice, not extremitie, <hi>Quod jure fit, profectò juste fit,</hi> Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith. That which is done by Law, is justly done. That failes sometimes. For <hi>Extremum jus,</hi> Rigour is injustice; and <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, too strickt severitie hurts, as <hi>Paphnutius</hi> said, the Church; so also the Common-wealth. <hi>Noli esse justus nimis;</hi> execute justice, but be not too just.</p>
            <p>Right reacheth farre, an ample Object, according to the cause and person. The Widdow, Stranger, or Orphan is opprest: their right is rescue from the Oppressor. The malefactor breakes the Law; his right is censure according to the fact. False accusation appeacheth the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent. The Iudge to doe them right, must acquit him of the Calumnie. In all things, to all men, looke what is just, that he must execute. Now as the Act had enemies; so hath the Object too, the same enemies, all the same: but more pernitious here, than there. Wee say, <hi>Prestat male agere, quâm nihil agere;</hi> better be doing somewhat, though but simply, than doe nought; but <hi>Praestat nihil agere, quàm malum agere;</hi> better be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> idle, than doe evill, a great deale. Better the Iudge not execute at all, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> than execute injustice. Feare, Favour, Lucre, did but there avert the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Iudge; here they pervert judgement. All three, and adde a fourth, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Malice, all foure are wresters of Right, changers of judgement, as <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> termes it.

               </gap> justice into iniquitie; tis <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons</hi> too; into Crie, into Oppression, into Wormewood, into Gall; the Prophets termes.</p>
            <p>Be Malice first. Spight will nere doe no Right. Will I acquite him, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> whom my heart hateth? His cause is just; but he is my enemy: I will now be aveng'd on him. <hi>Micaiah</hi> must to prison, though he prophesie the truth, for I hate him, saith King <hi>Ahab:</hi> and <hi>Pauls</hi> mouth be smitten, though he preach Gospell. A Iudge ought not be mov'd either <hi>Odio,</hi> or <hi>Studio;</hi> either condemne his foe, if he be innocent, or quit his friend, if he be guilty. He ought to execute justice to both indifferently. But Malice is revengefull. justice will Object, <hi>What evill hath he done?</hi> But Malice for all that will crie, <hi>Let him be crucified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Feare is a wreaster too. <hi>Pusillanimitie,</hi> a bad Advocate, a worse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Iudge: not hastie to pleade against the mightie, though for a Fee; but loath to <hi>determine,</hi> to give <hi>sentence</hi> against him, peremptorie sentence: whether the partie <hi>litigant,</hi> himselfe be mighty, or he have some po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Patron. First, he will take no Cognition of the Cause, if hee can
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:173124:153"/> decline it; [and he hath many <hi>Declentions.</hi>] If not; yet he will use all dilatorie courses, to wearie the complainer. Feare (you heard before) was a barre to execution. If needs he must give sentence; you shall finde the Saw sooth, Might overcomes Right. <hi>Naboth</hi> shall be ston'd, rather than <hi>Iesabel</hi> be displeased. Christ shall rather die, than <hi>Pilate</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend <hi>Caesar.</hi> Widdowes and Orphans, the booty of the Mighty, must hold the Iudge excused: he will not incurre displeasure for their sakes. Welfare those Catholicke Bishops, who charged by the <hi>Arian</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour to condemne <hi>Athanasius,</hi> both without witnesse, and unheard, onely <hi>Propter me,</hi> on the Emperours word, would rather hazard their states, then doe injustice. No <hi>Propter me,</hi> though nere so mightie, must scare the Iudge from executing right. For it is the will, and warrant too of the Almighty.</p>
            <p>Favour is next, a wrester too; else why is the Proverbe, <hi>Plus valet</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
               <hi>favor in judice, quàm lex in codice?</hi> An ounce of favour is worth a pound of law. <hi>Pusillanimitie,</hi> a foe to Iustice; but not so bad as Partialitie; that doth not trespasse it so oft as this. <hi>Prosopolatra</hi> is an <hi>Idololatra,</hi> an accepter of persons, a kind of Idolater. The Respect and Reverence, he owes to Right, he gives to the Rich, the Mightie, and the Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. <hi>Dat veniam corvis;</hi> their sentenses Cobwebs, call'd by <hi>Solon,</hi> small flies are caught, but the great breake thorough. Pettie theeves weare chaines of iron; but the grand robbers chaines of gold. Kindred and friendship incline him too. All accepting of persons, is perverting of lustice. God forbids it all. The Iudge may shew no favour, no not to the poore. Pittie him thou maist, thou must; but not <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in his cause; thou must not pittie him, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 3. Iudges must shew pittie in no cause, whatsoever, whose soever. For <hi>Malacausa est, quae requirit mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricordium;</hi> the Cause is naught, that hath neede of mercie. How much lesse then in the Causes of the mighty? Iustice must be equall unto all. <hi>Parvum ut magnum,</hi> God will have the Iudge <hi>heare small as well as great;</hi> rich and poore alike; and not respecting any person, to Iudge justly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene all.</p>
            <p>Painters and Poets taught Heathens this, who had not Scripture. <hi>Plato</hi> writes <hi>Rhadamanthus,</hi> the Iudge of hell, when a Ghost appeares before him, to receive his sentence; whose Ghost it is, he knowes not, nor he askes not. He lookes upon the soule, and according as he sees it, fowle or cleane, so he gives his doome. So should the Iudge on earth, looke on the Cause, not on the Person. The Eare and the Tongue are onely in Commission, the one to heare the Cause, the other to give the sentence, thats <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer.</hi> The eye hath nought to doe. A righteous Iudge is pictured without eyes. And the exactest Iudges, that humane story hath, were those in <hi>Athens,</hi> who alwayes judged by night.</p>
            <p>To justifie the wicked for his person sake, is grand Injustice. For not a just mans person ought to be respected. Love thy friend, and favour him; but <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               </gap>, to the judgement seat: that confines affection. There, be the same to friend and foe; upright to both. Neither use him the more hardly,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:173124:154"/> whom happly you hate; nor affoord more favour, there where you affect. Adde to this, Popularitie, a foolish favour, but a wrester of right too.

            <p>A Iudge should not be moved either <hi>minis</hi> or <hi>donis,</hi> with threats or gifts: and many a Magistrate condemnes the one, in magnanimitie. But <hi>Imitantur hamos dona,</hi> gifts are Sathans hookes, <hi>Dura ut infernus,</hi> they hold like hell. No marvell, if they catch a Iudge. Prophets have beene caught by them, (<hi>Balaam</hi> was) have beene brought by them to curse Gods people.

Heres one thing is. Tis more unjust, farre more; to take reward for injustice, reward for wrong. Such a Iudge (saith <hi>Salomon</hi>) is Gods abomination, the peoples execration; both accurst of God and man. Fire shall devoure the house of bribes, Gods fire. And woe to them, that justifie the wicked for reward. <hi>Vae vocantibus, Woe to them that call good evill, and evill good,</hi> for any cause; for Spight, for Feare, for Favour.

[That was <hi>Solons</hi> law. <hi>Plato</hi> was preciser. The Iudge might never <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Iustice is Gods rule: it must not be made crooked. A Virgin, <hi>Plato</hi> calls her so. The Iudge that wrongs her, commits Rape. Her wrong by him the greater, because hee is her Guardian. He that should keepe her, to betray her. Nay to betray his Prince, his Countrie, and his soule. An unjust Iudge is a traytor to all three. To his Prince: for <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice is the pillar of the Kings throne;</hi> A King said it, <hi>Salomon.</hi> The fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of it, is the falling of the King. For the transgressions of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, not punisht by the Magistrate, the Prince is often changed. Iustice and Mercie are the Kings keepers; <hi>Salomon</hi> saith that too. To pervert them, is to corrupt his keepers, to betray him. To his Countrie. For because of unrighteousnesse, Kingdomes are translated, <hi>De gente in gentem. Israel</hi> was into <hi>Ashur,</hi> and <hi>Iudah</hi> into <hi>Babylon.</hi> What a plague was in <hi>Israel,</hi> for the whoredome of the men with the daughters of <hi>Moab,</hi> till <hi>Phincas</hi> stood up, and executed? To his soule; Bribes are the devills baites; and his hooke is hid under them. The Iudge seazeth on the gift; Sathan seazeth on his soule. The <hi>Iewes,</hi> the <hi>Rabbins</hi> give a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veat to the Iudge that there is a sword betweene his thighes, and hell is open under him. Your businesse bids me end. God the righteous Iudge, guide your Spirits with his; that when the Iudge shall come, that must judge all, you that now judge men, may then judge Angells. Vnto him, God Almightie, Father, Sonne, and holy Ghost. &amp;c.</p>

               </gap>, both a just and godly King. the one is in the watch word, his care, that his Iudges should doe justice; the other in the reasons, his acknowledgement of himselfe to bee but Gods Surrogate.</p>
            <p>The first clause, though but circumstance, would not yet be balkt. <hi>Hee sayd unto the Iudges.</hi> All Kings wish not alike the peoples wealth. To see wrong righted, innocencie protected, vice punished, is not eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Princes studie. That probitie and piety flourish in the land, <hi>id popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus curet scilicet,</hi> let the people looke to that. <hi>Caesar</hi> like <hi>Gallio</hi> in the <hi>Acts, cares for no such things.</hi> Let Princes ply their pleasures. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore should Soveraigntie be dis-easd for the comminaltie? Worthy <hi>Iehosaphat</hi> is a precedent for Princes, zealous of the peace and prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of his subjects. Hee rides throughout his Realme, sets Iudges in each City, and gives a charge to every Iudge. My Text menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons no more. But hee did more. Hee provides for the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting not of Iustice onely, but Religion too. To the Priests and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites he also gives a charge, <hi>vers.</hi> 9. stild therefore by <hi>Iosephus</hi> very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedly, a just and godly King, carefull both of Church and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:173124:155"/> A point worthy prosecution in some other audience; tis unseasonable here; come to the next, the Caveat.</p>
            <p>Kings spend not lightly speech in vaine. When <hi>Caesar</hi> saith ought, what subject listens not? especially hee to whom hee speakes; and more, beginning with a monitorie terme. <hi>Hee sayd unto the Iudges,</hi> which are you. And his first word is <hi>Cavete, looke and beware, vestra res agitur: This day is this Scripture fulfilled in your eares.</hi> King <hi>Iames</hi> comes not behinde <hi>Iehosaphat.</hi> Hee hath given his charge, both to his Iudges and his Priests. For care of Iustice and Religion <hi>Iudah</hi> was not more happy then our Land. <hi>Heare O yee Iudges:</hi> the King speakes to you. <hi>Videte quid faciatis, See what yee doe.</hi> [See, to a Iudge? A Iudge, a just Iudge is pictured without eyes. How should hee see? Or say hee have eyes; yet the <hi>Athenian</hi> Iudges, the justest upon earth, judg'd ever in the night; thats not the fittest time for sight. But to see, is to be circumspect, See, that is, consider.] Authority is a tempter, judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature a function, subject to many falles. The charge needs a <hi>videte, See what yee doe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You give long charges to the inquest; tis fit. This to you is short. Few words, <hi>tria sunt omnia.</hi> Kings know to whom they speake, <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bum sapienti: See what yee doe.</hi> Which lest the brevity breede obscuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that all may understand, let one Scripture glosse another. What better interpretour of Gods meaning, then Gods selfe? <hi>Moses</hi> charge in <hi>Deuteronomie</hi> to the Iudges there, is a just commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary to the Kings here, <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 18, 19. first in the affirmative. <hi>They shall judge the people with righteous judgement.</hi> But thats but a <hi>vide ut fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceris,</hi> See, that you doe it. The phrase here implyes more, even a <hi>vide ne feceris,</hi> as the Angel sayd to <hi>Iohn, see you doe it not. Moses</hi> charge hath that too, the negative too, <hi>wrest not the Law; respect not persons; take no gifts.</hi> This charge is chargd with these particulars; they are all summ'd up in this briefe. I will discharge it with your patience; but in breefe too; I will but touth the severalls.</p>
            <p>First for the affirmative, that bids you judge the people with just judgement. Two things enjoyned in it, execution and integrity. The first, an act so necessary, that without it civill societies could not subsist. What say I civill? the savages themselves would perish, but for it. Men would be metamorphisd into wilde beasts; and every one would worry, and devoure another. The lawes have a <hi>videte quid faciatis</hi> too. They charge the people; the King charges the Iudges. They bid the people see to vertuous conversation; hee bids the Iudge see to righteous execution. Yea the Iudge has his <hi>videte quid faciatis</hi> too. Hee charges the Inquest. But judgement must succeede inquirie. Tis vaine to search out sinne, and not to censure it. Nature has given the body hands as well as eyes, and as many hands as eyes. They of the inquest are the Kings eyes, to spie out malefactours. The Iudges are his hands to draw forth his sword at them. What bootes their inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition without your execution? vice will not feare the eye, if it doe not feele the hand. It is not sight, but sentence, that awes sinne. The <hi>Rabbins</hi> have a proverbe <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> Transgressours need a
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:173124:156"/> Session house. The lawes suffice them not; there must be Magistrates to execute the Lawes. Nay the lists of Law increase the lusts of men. <hi>Nitimur in vetitum.</hi> Bad manners occasion the making of good lawes: but good lawes occasion the increasing of bad manners. That unlesse justice doe inflict the paine, as well as wisedome did exact the law; vice growes the grosser by prohibition; and (as S. <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh in another sense) <hi>sinne by the law growes out of measure sinfull.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where there wants execution, there wants not transgression. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punitie encourages to all licentiousnesse; not to light slippes onely, but to grand enormities. Indulgence begets not onely negligence, but is (as <hi>Bernard</hi> titles it) <hi>matrix insolentiae, nutrix impudentiae,</hi> both bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and feeder of brasen-browed wickednesse. Onely execution is the lawes life. The law without the Iudge is but a dead letter. The Law, the <hi>Anima,</hi> the soule of Common-wealths; the magistrate and judge, <hi>Anima animae</hi> the soule of that soule, hee animates the Law; who is therefore cald by <hi>Nazianzen,</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the living Law. Rape, Robberie, Idolatrie, were rife sometimes in <hi>Israel;</hi> But when, <hi>non erat Rex, there was no King in Israel,</hi> no Iudge for execution. The awe of the Law is small, where is no Magistrate. And where one is, it is not great, if he punish not offenders. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>hee carries not the Sword in vaine.</hi> Surely he does, if he execute not justice.</p>
            <p>Shall I with your favours, yee grave and reverend Iustices, aske you but one question? Why murther and robbery are more rare; drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse and whoredome, and prophanation of the Lords day, every towne full of them; nay not a house not tainted at least with one of them? The cause is evident, due execution in the former, non-execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the latter. The points behinde stint mee in this; the womans speech to <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon</hi> shall end it; when shee beseeching him to right her wrong, he answered, <hi>Nolo,</hi> he would not: <hi>Noli ergò reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nare,</hi> why (saith shee) then be not a King. Wilt thou not doe justice? why, then be not a Iudge. So the wise man bids, seeke not to be made a Iudge; but if thou be one, execute thy office.</p>
            <p>The next point is integrity: <hi>Moses</hi> charge, glosse to this, bids <hi>judicare justè,</hi> you must execute the Lawes, but <hi>righteously.</hi> There is a judge that will pardon Ravens, and censure Doves, loose <hi>Barabbas,</hi> and bind <hi>Christ.</hi> This is not execution, but persecution. That will give the widdowes house to the oppressour, the Orphanes field to the incroa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher. This is not <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> which <hi>Moses</hi> craves, two termes, judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and righteousnesse. This is neither. Tis (as <hi>Esay</hi> playeth with the words) not <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> but <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

Hee shall heare a <hi>Maledictus,</hi> not from the Priest onely, and all the people say <hi>Amen</hi> to it; but from Christs selfe also at the resurrection, <hi>Ite maledicti, Depart from me yee cursed. Salomon</hi> askes, <hi>Cui vae, to whom belongs a woe? Esay</hi> answers him, <hi>vae vocantibus, to them that call good evill, evill good.</hi> Woes and Anathemaes waiting on Thrones and Consistories, that judge unjustly, the charge needs a <hi>videte, videte quid faciatis, Take heed what yee doe.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="277" facs="tcp:173124:156"/>
            <p>The Negatives are next, as naturall to the charge, as the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and as needfull to be noted in these times. <hi>Wrest not the Law. Respect not Persons. Take no gifts.</hi> He that with the Ruler in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell can say, can truely say, <hi>hec omnia custodivi,</hi> hee hath observed all these; when the Sonne of Man shall sit in his Throne of Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, <hi>Hee shall also sit upon a Throne, and judge the twelve tribes of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the first, <hi>Wrest not the Law; Iudices</hi> be <hi>juris indices</hi> they must <hi>Ius dicere,</hi> thence is their name, they must say the <hi>Iust</hi> Law, both say it, and doe it. <hi>Ius</hi> wrested it not <hi>Ius,</hi> but <hi>vis;</hi> the letters transposed, and justice perverted. There are two Treachers against Truth, <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> saith, <hi>Corruptor Stylus, &amp; Adulter Sensus,</hi> to forge the Text, or to force the Sense. Hereticks do both. A Iudge cannot well do the one. The words of the Law are hardly altered, but soone misconstered. And this, <hi>Tertullian</hi> termes adultery, <hi>adulter sensus.</hi> The Iudge, which should be <hi>aequus,</hi> is <hi>moechus</hi> by that act. <hi>Tertullian</hi> is too milde, tis Rape. Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice is a Virgin; to force the Law, is to ravish her. Tis more, tis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest too, incestuous rape. Iudges are the Fathers of the Law; they force their Daughter, when they wrest the Law. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, they sit to Iudge <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>juxta legem, according to the Law.</hi> The wrester of it doth not so. He judges not <hi>juxta,</hi> but either <hi>citra</hi> or <hi>ultra,</hi> or <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra,</hi> which is worse. He ties the witnesse titely to the truth: he must say it, all it, nought but it. But himselfe will haply deale loosely with the Law, leave something out, put something in; nay haply quite crosse it, wrest the words even to a contrary sense: <hi>Statuimus, i. Abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> saith the <hi>Canonist. Romano, i. Constantinopolitano:</hi> white, <hi>i.</hi> Blacke; <hi>London, i. Yorke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He is the Lawes interpreter; he must not make it speake, but what it meanes. The Law is the heart, the Iudge is the Mouth. If he speake one thing, when it meanes another; he makes the Law a <hi>Iesuite,</hi> to have a mentall Reservation. Traitours are rackt, to force them to confesse truth. The Law should not be rackt, to force it to speake falsehood. Scepters borne by Kings, and the Mases of all Magistrates, are all straight, Emblemes of Iustice. The Iudge, that wrests the Law, crookes the Kings Scepter. He makes the Kings Lawes, like the Popes Canons, <hi>Plumbeos &amp; Cereos,</hi> as <hi>Budaeus</hi> termeth them, waxen and leaden lawes, to bend and bowe, and be pliable every way. The Iudge condemnes the forger: but this is forgery in the Iudge. Tis not my Censure; tis a Kings, <hi>Psalme 94. 20. The throne of iniquity forgeth wrong for a Law,</hi> that is, worketh wrong upon the Law; that is, forceth the Sense of it, to warrant injustice. [To end this, <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> said, in the Gospels dayes, <hi>Crooked things should be made straight.</hi> But the perverse Iudge makes a Straight thing Crooked. Enough of this.]</p>
            <p>The second Prohibitive couched in this <hi>Caveat</hi> is, <hi>Thou shalt respect no persons.</hi> There is a due respect of persons, in Offices of honour, and in overtures of love. To the Person of the aged, my Parent, or the Magistrate, I must doe reverence: more then to others. To the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the Poore, my Kinsman, or my Friend, I must show kindnesse,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:173124:157"/> rather then to others. This respect Nature craves, Nurture too, Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture too. But <hi>Moses</hi> meanes in judgment. The Court and Consistory must know no person. Elsewhere thou maist; but thou must not in the Gate.</p>
            <p>Tis spight, or feare, or favour workes this injustice. For the first, Spight will nere doe right. Will I acquit him whom I hate? His cause is just; but he is mine enemy; I will now be avenged on him. Iustice will object, what evill hath he done? But malice for all that, will cry, <hi>Let him be crucified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the second: pusillanimity an absurd infirmity in a Iudge. <hi>Iethro</hi> will have Magistrates to be men of courage, <hi>Exod.</hi> 18. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, strenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and undaunted, not to be afraid of frownes, not from the stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest foreheads. Gods selfe forbids a Iudge to feare, to feare the face of man, because the throne is Gods. Hath a great man a bad matter before a timorous Iudge? First he will take no cognition of the cause, if he can decline it. If not, yet he will use all dilatory courses, to wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the Complainer. If needes he must give sentence; Widdowes and Orphans, the booty of the mighty, must hold the Iudge excused; he will not incurre displeasure for their sakes. Nay <hi>Naboth</hi> shall be stoned, rather then <hi>Iesabel</hi> shall be displeased. Christ shall rather dye, then <hi>Pilate</hi> offend <hi>Caesar.</hi> Well fare those Catholicke Bishops, who char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the <hi>Arian</hi> Emperour to condemne <hi>Athanasius,</hi> both with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out witnesse, and unheard onely <hi>propter me,</hi> upon the Emperours word, would rather hazard their states, then doe injustice. No <hi>propter me,</hi> though nere so mighty; must scare the Iudge from executing right. For it is the will and warrant too of the <hi>Almighty. Fiat Iustitia, &amp; ruat Mundus;</hi> doe Iustice, doe it with a sound heart: let the world fall on thee, it will not bruise thee.</p>
            <p>For the third. A Iudge ought not be mov'd either <hi>Odio</hi> or <hi>Studio,</hi> as not to cast his Foe, if he be innocent, so not to quit his friend, if he be guilty. <hi>Amicus Plato, magis amica veritas.</hi> My dearest friend, my nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest kinsmen, are not so deare, or neare to me, as Iustice, as my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, as my King. I owe my kinsman and my friend, my love: but I owe love, and Loyalty, and Allegeance unto these. Let the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Magistrate heare the heathen Oratour, <hi>exuat personam Iudicis, qui induit Amici,</hi> the Affection of a Friend, fits not the function of a Iudge. He must say with <hi>Levi</hi> to his Brethren, to his Parents, yea even unto his Children, <hi>Nescio vos, I know you not, Deut.</hi> 33. All partiality is flat iniquity. The Iudge may show no favour, no not to the Poore. Pity him thou maist, thou must, but not <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: in his cause, thou must not pitty him. <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 3. For <hi>Mala causa est, que requirit misericordiam,</hi> the matter is naught that hath need of mercy.</p>
            <p>The last Prohibitive forbids bribery, the bane, maine bane of Iustice. Malice, partiality, pusillanimity, all biassers of Iudgement. But this the devils speciall wrinch above the rest, to wrest all right. Feare and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour were charmes both, but the charmes of flesh and blood. But a bribe is a spell, a spell from hell; it bindes faster then they both. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution haply may conquer feare, and Religion often masters Love: But filthy lucre, not Right, not Reason, not Reputation, not Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:173124:157"/> can loosen it. <hi>Prosopoleptes,</hi> an accepter of Persons will some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times doe Iustice; Affection will be checkt. But <hi>Doroleptes</hi> an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepter of gifts; will nere doe Iustice, Corruption will not yeeld.</p>
            <p>A Iudge should not be mooved either <hi>Minis</hi> or <hi>Donis,</hi> with Threates or Gifts; and many a Magistrate contemnes the one in magnanimity. But <hi>imitantur hamos Dona</hi>—Gifts are Sathans hookes, <hi>dura ut Infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> they hold like Hell. Beware of bribes all Iudges. Gifts are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led blessings in the Scripture phrase. But the Scripture curseth them unto the Iudge. He is (saith <hi>Solomon</hi>) Gods abomination, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples execration; both accurst of God and Man. <hi>Fire</hi> (saith <hi>Eliphaz shall devoure the house of bribes, Gods</hi> fire, <hi>Iob</hi> 15. 34. To close up this second Clause; the Wise man bids, <hi>Seeke not to be made a Magistrate.</hi> But if thou be one: execute thine office. Nor execute it onely, but use Iustice too. <hi>Moses</hi> bad <hi>Iudge righteously.</hi> Else art thou but a meere usurper. For <hi>Quod juste non tractas, jure non tenes, Augustine,</hi> thou holdest thy place unjustly, if thou performe it not uprightly. So much for the Caveat.</p>
            <p>The Reason yet remaines, <hi>For you execute the Iudgments of God, not of Man.</hi> Kings Causes aske good care, great consideration. Hee that will manage them, must <hi>videre quid faciat,</hi> looke well, what he does. But Iudgement is <hi>Gods</hi> businesse, not the Kings; not Mans, but Gods. Cald I this Clause, a Reason? or Treason rather? to deny Iudica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be the Kings, Princes to be Iudges. Tis well a King he saith it. But negatives are taken sometimes comparatively. <hi>God will have Mercy and not Sacrifice, i.</hi> rather then Sacrifice. He refuseth not Sacrifice; but he preferres Mercy before it. The Iudgements which you execute, are not mans, but Gods, <hi>i.</hi> not mans so much as Gods. They are both Gods and mans; Gods and the Kings too; but principally Gods: the Kings, but under God.</p>
            <p>The Prince is Gods Leivetenant. Popes say, they are Christs Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cars. Surely Kings are, <hi>Vicarii Dei,</hi> Gods Vicegerents, and Popes have sometimes cald them so, <hi>Eleutherius</hi> did a King of our Land. God cals the Throne his Throne. It is the Kings, but under him. Tis <hi>Per me Reges regnant;</hi> but <hi>Pro me</hi> is true too. Not <hi>by</hi> God onely, but <hi>for</hi> God also doe Kings raigne, they governe in his stead.

            <p>Good cause then have all Magistrates to see unto their Charge, to eye their actions well. To see, first, <hi>ut faciant,</hi> that they Execute judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the first thing in the Glosse, and exprest in the next verse, <hi>ut faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atis,</hi> as <hi>Iunius</hi> turnes it, <hi>that they doe it:</hi> that they doe it diligently, the vulgar Latine Text.

               <pb n="280" facs="tcp:173124:158"/> terme. And so the King saith here, that <hi>with God is none iniquity.</hi> Then to see, <hi>ne faciant, that they doe not.</hi> Namely not, <hi>Wrest the Law.</hi> For it is Gods Text. Poets can say, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the Lawes come from God. Not Scriptures onely, but the Lawes also are the Lords. Men make them, but God guides them. They are Gods: he wrongs God, that wrests them.</p>
            <p>Neither <hi>Respect Persons,</hi> nor <hi>Receive Gifts.</hi> For the next verse tels you, <hi>God doth neither.</hi> Feares an inferiour Magistrate, any mans of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, the displeasure of the mighty?

            </p>
            <p>Take not Gifts. Iudgement is Gods; sell not the things of God. For the whole execution of the Office of the Magistrate, remember still that the businesse is Gods: [Himselfe sits among you, <hi>David</hi> saith, in your assemblies. The King bids in the next verse, let Gods feare be upon you; not <hi>Pavor dominorum,</hi> but <hi>Pavor Domini,</hi> the feare, not of Lords, who are men, but of the Lord, who is God. <hi>See you therefore, what ye doe:</hi> for he seeth all your doings.

Some Scriptures have two senses, <hi>Literall</hi> and <hi>Mysticall:</hi> this hath. The literall is the naturall antipathie betweene them.

            <p>The Serpent is the type, the figure of the devill: tis Sathan is here meant. Sathan, of all the creatures chose to enter into it, to tempt the man: and therefore of all the creatures hee is cald a Serpent most, throughout the Scriptures. <hi>Esay</hi> calls him so, <hi>Paul</hi> does, <hi>Iohn</hi> does in the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> and what is <hi>Sathanas,</hi> but <hi>Serpens apostata, Iustin Martyr</hi> saith, and wicked men, termd here his seede, cald Serpents too. The Pharisees are, even by Christs selfe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 33. Tis fit the Sire surname the sonne, like in nature, and therefore in name too; subtill and poysonous, to deceive, and to destroy. Sathan their father, <hi>vos ex patre Diabolo, Ioh.</hi> 8. 44. They his sonnes, <hi>Fili diaboli, Paul</hi> calls <hi>Elymas</hi> so, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. His sonnes, and therefore Serpents.</p>
            <p>Before I descend to the particular termes, because the Text is darke, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> I paraphrase it thus: <hi>It, i.</hi> Christ, and man his members; <hi>shall bruise,</hi>

               <hi>Esay</hi> 53. the Prophet five times applies to Christ. It must be <hi>Schiloh,</hi> old <hi>Iacobs</hi> word, <hi>qui mitten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus est,</hi> one whom God should send of purpose. It must bee the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias, qui ungendus est,</hi> Gods Christ, his annointed, King over Gods <hi>Israel;</hi> to put downe all power, whatsoever the usurping Prince of this world should arme against his people. It must be hee, that (as <hi>Paul</hi> speakes) should <hi>lead captivitie captive.</hi> It must be <hi>Michael,</hi> must fight against the <hi>Dragon; Michael,</hi> that is, who is as God; that is Christ, and therefore the terme here <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap> is reckoned by the <hi>Rabbins</hi> amongst the names of God, <hi>Esay</hi> 43. 8. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, in him and by him. Sathans power being sinne and death, hee that will bruise them, must bee free from both, subject to neither. Christ was so onely. Hee dyed indeed; but not for sinne: for sinne, but our sinne, not his owne. For hee had none. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>hee knew none; Peter</hi> saith, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap> the onely <hi>It,</hi> can quell the Serpent. Nature is powerfull; but tis not <hi>It.</hi> The Law strong too; but tis not <hi>It.</hi> Nothing is <hi>It,</hi> but Christ. <hi>Non est, nomen aliud, Peter</hi> saith, <hi>theres none other name under heaven, by which we may be saved; none other name, i.</hi> none other thing.</p>
            <p>Secondly for our selves, many men are meant too, righteous men, all beleevers, true beleevers, the whole Church. For it is a body my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall; Christ the head of it; all beleevers the members. <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> hands in that body, <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> other parts. God make me a Heele in it; I shall be happy. <hi>David</hi> would not scorne to bee a <hi>Dore-keeper</hi> in Gods house: nor must I, thou, any man, to be a Heele in that body, whereof Christ is the head. Comfortable to bee any offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer in Gods house; honourable to bee any member in Christs body. Of this body every member hath an Interest in this <hi>It.</hi> Not onely <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaels</hi> selfe, but his Angels also fought against the <hi>Dragon.</hi> Those An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are not onely Princes and Preachers, the zealous Magistrate and Minister, the one by the sword, the other by the word, to beat and batter sinne, the great <hi>Sultan</hi> of Sathan: but even every Christian, every faithfull Christian, by the assistance of Christs spirit, to fight against the Flesh, to crucifie the lusts, which are the power of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and cald by the Apostle, <hi>Angelus Sathanae,</hi> even the devills angels, and the Serpents Seede.</p>
            <p>Here will some Romanists wrangle, and say, I wring the Text, I reade not right. Tis not <hi>Ipsum, It:</hi> Tis <hi>Ipsa, Shee.</hi> The vulgar Latine hath it so, which the councill of <hi>Trent</hi> makes onely authenticall. Both Greeke and Hebrew, Septuagints, and originall reade it Masculine, and all Translations saving that. That skills not. Its their Oracle. Tis (<hi>shee</hi>) must bruise the Serpents head. All expositours say, <hi>Hee,</hi> as mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Christ. But they turne easily Hee into Shee. But what shee? Christs Mother; <hi>Mary,</hi> not Christ. Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> more devout, then learned, fathers that absurditie. That blessed woman tis not fit wee disgrace. But <hi>Peter</hi> must not be robd, to inrich <hi>Paul:</hi> much lesse Christ doshonourd, to honour <hi>Mary.</hi> Tis <hi>Partus Mariae,</hi> not <hi>Maries</hi> selfe, but <hi>Maries</hi> seede, old <hi>Irenaeus</hi> saith. Themselves say, <hi>Gregory</hi> doth <hi>de Valentia,</hi> that it is the Catholick Churches doctrine, that it was the Virgins Sonne should breake the Serpents head. As for the Translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as authenticall as the <hi>Tridentine</hi> Concill hath decreed it, some of themselves doubt not to call it false here. <hi>Francis Georg</hi> the Minorite doth in his Problemes.</p>
            <p>Tis meant no more of <hi>Mary,</hi> then of other holy women, of <hi>Lois,</hi> of <hi>Lydia,</hi> of <hi>Hannah,</hi> of <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> Nay tis meant no more of women, then of men. If Sexe have any priviledge, it is the Male: for the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noune</hi> is <hi>Masculine.</hi> But all men, all women, too weak for this worke. Surely man shall doe it; but not meere man; but <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, one both God and man; the Sonne of man, but yet the Sonne of God; who should call <hi>Mary</hi> mother, but God Father. Christ onely of himselfe; and then man through Christ. Man and woman all good men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, not our Lady only, (though she principally in regard of her happy birth) but all through Christ. S. <hi>Paul</hi> faith, <hi>the victory is through our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> Leave the Agent; heare the Act.</p>
            <pb n="284" facs="tcp:173124:160"/>
            <p>
               <hi>The Serpents head, i.</hi> the strength of Sathan in sinne and death, the womans Seede (God saith) <hi>shall bruise.</hi> So is the last Translation. The <hi>Geneva</hi> hath, <hi>shall breake.</hi> The terme in both members is one in the originall. Why should Man varie words, where God doth not? Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they thought bruising, too lanke a word, too shranke to expresse Christs peremptorie power. Breaking, would doe it more fully, more powerfully. But weigh the <hi>Object</hi> with the Act. It is the <hi>Head;</hi> thats worse hurt, bruisd, then broken. And tis a <hi>Serpents</hi> head. To break <hi>it,</hi> is improper phrase: farre more kind and naturall, to bruise. This Act, because the Agent was twofold, Christ, and his members; first lay it to Christ.</p>
            <p>Sinne, if you please, the <hi>Sinciput</hi> of Sathans head, see that bruisd first. Shall I say with <hi>Paul,</hi> Christ hath washt it, he hath cleansd it? That sounds absurdly, Christ to wash Sathans head. Thats worse then <hi>Peters</hi> feete. But Metaphors will not ever match. Thinke sinne a <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, uncleannesse, <hi>Pauls</hi> terme often. Mans soule was soild with it. Christs blood hath cleansd it, washt it out. Sinne a spot, a foule one; a Staine, a deepe one; <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levit, Peters</hi> terme, Christ hath spungd it, scourd it out. An humour, a right <hi>peccant</hi> humour; Christ hath purgd it, <hi>Pauls</hi> terme too. The Devills worke in us; Christ hath dissolvd it. The Devills worke? the Devills wound, a deadly wound; Christ hath heald it. Sathans obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, our hand and seale to it, <hi>Paul</hi> calls it our <hi>Chirographum;</hi> hee meant to show it, and to sue it at the day of judgement: Christ hath crost and canceld it <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, defaced it. Hee hath done more, tooke it up with him at his passion, and naild it to the Crosse, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 14. Nay <hi>sustulit de medio, Pauls</hi> phrase there, utterly abolisht it. What can I say more? <hi>Iohn</hi> saith it too; both the Baptist, and Evangelist, the sinnes of the world, <hi>sustulit,</hi> Gods Lambe hath taken them away.</p>
            <p>Now for the <hi>Occipitium,</hi> the hinder part of the Serpents Head, thats death, Christ bruised that too, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Iustin Martyrs</hi> terme, death done to death. Christ cries in the Prophet, <hi>Ero mors tua O mors, O death, I will be thy death, Ose.</hi> 13. Christ there but threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens it. Hee performd it at his Passion. By his death he <hi>loosed the sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes of death,</hi> Saint <hi>Peter</hi> saith; or rather by his Rising. Death is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede still; thats but dissolution; thats but a leape to life. But damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the right death, and right sorrowes of death. Christ hath loosed them. The first foote Christ set on ground, rising from Grave, trode on the Serpents Head so hard, that it bruised it, brake it, chrusht it in pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Leave we Christ; come to his members.</p>
            <p>Christ well might bee too hard for Sathan; hee was God. For him to bruise his head, an easie Act. But how shall man, weake man doe it? This was answered before, man as Christs member, assisted by Christs Spirit, shall doe it too. First for sinne; the regenerate man crucifies the flesh, <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>mortifies the lusts of it;</hi> doth with <hi>Paul,</hi>

            <p>It is the <hi>Head:</hi> of which to speake a part, is but <hi>actum agere.</hi> Wee have seene it sufficiently in the second terme. The devill hath no head: for he is a spirit.

            <p>Tis bruising too. Christs selfe was bruised by Sathan, <hi>attritus est,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> saith <hi>Esay</hi> 53. not toucht onely, one terme there, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap> but <hi>smit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten;</hi> not that softly, but <hi>wounded,</hi> the Prophet goes <hi>gradatim.</hi> I should but trouble you with the Hebrew termes. The bruise seene by the blewnesse; thats there too, <hi>Cujus vibice sanati sumus.</hi> Gessed by the paine, the matchlesse paine. As <hi>Vnctus prae consortibus, Psa.</hi> 45. so <hi>punctus</hi> too, prickt and stung by the Serpent, more than ere was any man. <hi>See, if any sorrow were ever like to mine,</hi> Christ cries in the Prophet. So ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame, that it strained from his face, droppes of bloud in the garden, and wrested from his mouth that strong crie upon the Crosse, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken men? Quid nobis, &amp; tibi, What have wee to doe with thee?</hi> Cried the Feends in the possessed? Indeed one would thinke, the devill should not dare to have to doe with Christ. But hee durst; not by his Agents onely, as in his Passion; but personally once, hand to hand. The Serpent assaulted him, bit at his heele thrice. But his teeth entred not. Christ was shod with the preparation, not of the Gospell, as <hi>Paul</hi> bids, but of the Law, which is all one, too tough a lether for the devills teeth.</p>
            <p>Christs Church, Gods children, Sathan bruises too. God saith here, but the womans seede. But the womans selfe Sathan bruised too; <hi>Eve,</hi> the first woman, <hi>Adam</hi> the first man: Such a bruise, as all their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren have halted on't ever since. Sinne is the Serpents tooth; it bites us. Our owne lust, the devills fist; it buffets us. Tis <hi>Pauls</hi> terme, who calls it Sathans messenger. <hi>David</hi> felt his fist in the matter of <hi>Vrias,</hi> and in numbring his people. Tis said expresly, Sathan incited him, 1 <hi>Chro. 21. Peter</hi> felt the stroke so strong, that it fetcht water out of his eyes. <hi>Paul</hi> felt it so strong too, that it made him crie <hi>Infelix ego.</hi> The Crosse the devills flaile; is it not called tribulation, <hi>i.</hi> threshing? With it he bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and bruiseth Gods people. It is the devills Fanne; hee winnowes us tis Christs terme, <hi>i.</hi> shakes and tosses us. In a word, he is the Presser, the Crusher, the Galler, the Grinder, the Wounder of the godly. Like the womans daughter in the Gospell, they are vexed, they are mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably vexed of the devill. Thats for Sathans selfe.</p>
            <p>Now for his seed, wicked men, Serpentine broode, their tongue full of poyson, Saint <hi>Iames</hi> saith; Adders poyson, <hi>David</hi> saith. They hisse like them; they sting like them. Priests and Elders called Christ a Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, a Deceiver, a <hi>Samaritane,</hi> and said, he had a devill. Theres their hisse. They and <hi>Pilat,</hi> take, bind, scourge, and crucifie him. Theres their sting. So they doe Christs members. To end this, the Sunne is not safe, nor the Moone, but are eclipsed, if they come but neere the Dragons taile. His taile so strong, that it drew downe the third part of the starres, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 12. His power not in his mouth onely, to bite; but in his taile too, to sting; <hi>retrò timencus,</hi> as one saith of the Scorpion.</p>
            <p>Yet rests the Object of this Act, the <hi>Heele:</hi> its the heele of my Text. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Christs Act, and Sathans was the same, twas <hi>bruising</hi> both. But theres great oddes in the Object. <hi>A capite ad calcem.</hi> Twas Sathans Head; tis but Christs <hi>Heele.</hi> A bruise may be painfull in the heele; but happly mortall in the head. Christ and his followers bruised by Sathan and
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:173124:161"/> his instruments, but in the heele. Great is the devills might, and malice both, both his might, and his spight. But God hath him in a tie, and his furie is confin'd. <hi>Paul</hi> stiles him Prince of the Aire; he fights aloft, threatens our heads: but they are healed with the Helmet of salvation. If he will hurt; he must stoope, turne Serpent, and be content to bruise the heele. Thats Sathans worst and most, his utmost. His power is but as God permits: who saith to Sathan, as he did unto the sea, <hi>Hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thou shalt come; but goe no further,</hi> not <hi>ultra crepidam.</hi> He put <hi>Iob</hi> in his hands, but with a but. Have power over his goods, servants, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; <hi>but touch not his person.</hi> And againe, have power over his body; but touch not his life. Bruise the womans seed; but the heele onely.</p>
            <p>First, for Christs selfe, how Sathan bruised him, you have heard, stung him even to death. I said before, Christ crucified sinne, <hi>sustulit,</hi> tooke it up to the Crosse with him. But so did Sathan crucifie Christ too. Not his heele onely. There were three nailes, as you may see in every Crucifixe. But one was bestowed upon his feete, driven through them both. His hands were nailed too. <hi>Foderunt,</hi> saith <hi>David, they pierced my hands, and my feete.</hi> They did more; they pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced his side too. But Christs whole Humanitie was but as his heele, the lower part of Christ.</p>
            <p>Secondly for Christs members; the Serpents bruising of our heele, is partly his externall infesting of our bodies by the malice of the world, and partly his internall assaulting of our soules by the lusts of our flesh. Our heele is the old <hi>Adam,</hi> our unregenerate part; to which much fowlenesse growes; it is so neere the ground. <hi>Paul</hi> bids, looke to our feete, when we come into Gods house. And Christ tells <hi>Peter,</hi> his feete onely neede washing. His hands and head needed not; they were cleane. Christ was his Head, and his hands the holy Ghost. <hi>In calcaneo quisque labitur, Aug.</hi> Tis at the heele, that a man slippes, tis the foote that trippes, and stumbles. <hi>David</hi> is affraid of the iniquity of his heeles, <hi>Psal.</hi> 49. The Spirit is the head in the regenerate man; the flesh the taile and heele, dagled with the durt of every sinne: the law of the members kicking against the law of the minde, treading under foote the pearles of Gods Word.</p>
            <p>The devill would devoure; S. <hi>Peter</hi> saith, he <hi>seekes</hi> that, <hi>Quaerit, quem devoret;</hi> and he doth many. But Christs members he doth not, cannot; bruises them onely. He winnowes them, Christs terme, shakes and tosses them. Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> saith, <hi>Non tangit, he toucheth them not.</hi> Surely he doth, both <hi>tangit &amp; angit,</hi> both touch and tease them. He did <hi>Iob,</hi> he doth all men, both outwardly by affliction, and inwardly by tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> meanes, and the note is in the Margin, out of <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin, Lethali vulnere,</hi> he doth not touch them with a mortall wound. The hurt is onely in the heele; thats farre from the heart; where the life lies. Nay, <hi>Iahns</hi> selfe saith in the <hi>Apoc. Chap.</hi> 13. he shall conquer them, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>vers.</hi> 7. he shall <hi>Kill</hi> them, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. But the note is good there too; their bodies, not their soules. The bodie compared with the soule is but the heele.</p>
            <p>I say, the devill bruiseth us, both by sinne, but not totally; and by
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:173124:162"/> affliction, but not mortally. Not totally by sinne; for tempt the flesh he may; but the Spirit is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. will not, can not be tempted; if God abide with it who is not tempted, Saint <hi>Iames</hi> saith. No nor finally; for we stumble, but recover; we fall, but rise againe: we fall and that fearefully; Sathan may foulely foile the best. Looke on <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Peter.</hi> But grace lets them not lie long, reaches her hand to them, to lift them up againe. Not totally by affliction. For though he kills us, wee live still. Tis but the first death that Gods children die; no death in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to them, tis hut a dissolution. The second death, <hi>i.</hi> damnation, the right death, the righteous die not that.</p>
            <p>To conclude, beware how thou walkest; <hi>David</hi> saith the devill <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servat calcaneum,</hi> watches thy heeles. Goe not bare-footed, as some Popish Friers doe; but be <hi>shodde</hi> (as <hi>Paul</hi> bids) <hi>with the preparation of the Gospell.</hi> So the Serpent shall not bite thee. Let the devill the <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as <hi>Philo</hi> before called him, the Darter, let him shoote his dartes, his fiery darts at thee; thy shield of faith shall quench them.</p>

Tis by way of <hi>Ironie:</hi> tis not <hi>Asseveranter,</hi> meant in sad sooth, but mockingly. Man double mockt, (pride well deserves it) first deluded by Sathan, now derided by God. The Serpents mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age malitious, <hi>you shall be as Gods,</hi> tempts and lyes: Gods but scorne onely, <hi>Man is become like us.</hi> Sathans meaning, Delusion; Gods Irrision, Saint <hi>Ambroses</hi> terme. Others expound this Scripture otherwise: but I follow the sense thats most receivd. This <hi>Ironie</hi> of Gods, to propine mans pride the more to Gods contempt, is prefac't with an <hi>Ecce, Behold,</hi> saith God.</p>
            <p>There are sundry sorts of <hi>Ecce's</hi> in Scripture. There is <hi>Ecce Annunti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antis,</hi> the Angels <hi>Ecce</hi> to <hi>Mary, Behold thou shalt conceive.</hi> And there is <hi>Ecce Indicantis, Iohn Baptists Ecce,</hi> pointing at Christ, <hi>Behold the Lamb of God,</hi> and there is <hi>Ecce Admirantis,</hi> and some moe, many moe, not skilling now. This is <hi>Irridentis, Behold the man. Pilat</hi> parallels it, <hi>Ecce Homo</hi> too, <hi>Irridens utique dixit,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Ambrose,</hi> meant meerely to scorne him. Tis but a particle; yet not idle, specially in Gods mouth. Tis fit wee waigh the lightest word God speakes; though but one bare syllable: this is no more in the originall. A word, that well accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modates
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:173124:163"/> the case here. Pride well deserves to be usherd with an <hi>Ecce.</hi> For it affects gazing and wonderment.</p>
            <p>The proud man thinkes, he is <hi>Homo spectabilis;</hi> greeves, if he be not lookt at: doth all things (Christ saith) <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, a spectacle, not to man, and Angels onely, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> speakes in another case; but even to Gods selfe too: calls (as it were) to all the persons of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, to looke on him: but with scorne, as the people doe at every proud man, man or woman. They are <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> terme too, <hi>made a gazing-stocke:</hi> but <hi>Opprobriis,</hi> as it is there, with scoffes and scornes; a gazing-stocke, but a laughing-stock. <hi>Behold</hi> saith God, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Behold?</hi> Who must behold? God speakes the <hi>Ecce</hi> to himselfe, one Person of the Trinity to another; <hi>Behold, man is become like one of us.</hi> Yet <hi>Moses</hi> recording it, meant man should behold too. Two things the Text bids us Behold; Gods scorne at mans pride, and Mans lust to be like God. The one in the forme of the speech, the other in the matter.</p>
            <p>For the first, the malicious <hi>Manichee</hi> consters the speech in earnest. But Saint <hi>Austin</hi> answers him, that tis no affirmation, but a meere exprobration, if the Reader be <hi>doctus pronuntiator,</hi> not <hi>indoctus ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniator, tom. 6. col.</hi> 5 95. The Accent of the speech shewes it to be an <hi>Ironie,</hi> a speech of scorne. For else it were not true, were it not <hi>Iro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall.</hi> Man to be like God, as one of the Persons of the Deitie, were impious blasphemie in a mans mouth. Meant simplie without Figure, it is false, and tis impossible, that God should lye, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith. But tis an <hi>Ironie.</hi> A figure which I mervaile, that the <hi>Iesuits</hi> never markt. It would palliate their perjuries farre better then <hi>Equivocation.</hi> Faine would they defend their false equivocations by precedents in Scripture, by examples of Patriarks, Prophets, Apostles, Angels, Christs selfe. But their instances are straind and idle. But <hi>Ironies</hi> in Scripture are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and plaine, and used by Gods owne selfe, not by man onely, and Angels. By <hi>Salomon</hi> to the licentious young man, <hi>rejoyce, walke on in the wayes of thy Heart, and the lusts of thine eyes.</hi> And to the sluggard, <hi>yet a little sleepe.</hi> By <hi>Micaiah</hi> to <hi>Ahab, Goe up and prosper.</hi> By <hi>Elias</hi> to <hi>Baals</hi> Priests, <hi>Cry aloud; for hee is a God.</hi> By an Angel, <hi>Hee that is filthy, let him be filthy still.</hi> By Saint <hi>Paul, Condonate mihi hanc injuriam.</hi> By Christ to the Pharisees, <hi>Fulfill you also the measure of your Fathers;</hi> and in the eleventh of <hi>Zacharie,</hi> a <hi>goodly price,</hi> Christs too.

Christ shewes, calls him the Prince of this world. <hi>Antiochus</hi> thought he could saile over mountaines, <hi>Senacharib</hi> drie up rivers with the soles of his feete. <hi>Quod Iovi, hoc Regi licet,</hi> saith <hi>Licus</hi> in <hi>Seneca,</hi> what can God doe, that Kings can not?</p>
            <p>There is, <hi>Gods</hi> like unto <hi>Men, Act.</hi> 14. 11. God may take mans shape, any creatures shape; may doe, hath done often; appeared like a Man, like an Angell, like Fire, like cloven Tongues. All the Persons have at times. Why should we doubt of God, when we heare the devill hath? Nay the second Person in Trinitie, not became <hi>as</hi> man only, but <hi>was</hi> man too; tooke not mans shape, but his substance, mans body, soule and body both. But man, Gods creature, to become like God, to be as his Creatour; thats such absurditie, such stupiditie, that the beasts might have said of <hi>Adam,</hi> Behold, the man is become like one of us. Yea and withall, such Ambition, such <hi>Luciferian</hi> pride, that the devills might cry, <hi>Ecce,</hi> Behold, man is become like one of us. For the Dragon and his Angells were the first, that fell into that follie. Nay one once indeed by pride turned beast. Proud <hi>Nebuchodonosor</hi> was driven from men, ate grasse as the Oxen; his haires grew like feathers, and his nailes like birds clawes. Both Birds and Beasts might say of him, Behold this man is become like one of us; and <hi>Iudas</hi> by malice turned devill; Christ calls him so. The Feends might crie of him, Behold, this man is become like one of us. But man to be as God, deserves the scorne of God; and is odious to man too. Reason loathes it, Eare abhorres it.</p>
            <p>But how saith God, <hi>Like one of us?</hi> Why not rather like us in generall? Man haply usurpes upon Gods generall Offices, common to all the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. But hath any sonne of <hi>Adam</hi> ever singled out any one Person a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, and sought to be like him? Some have, <hi>Epiphanius</hi> saith, <hi>Simon Magus</hi> made himselfe God the Father, <hi>Haer.</hi> 21. in <hi>Princ.</hi> And <hi>Monta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> would be the holy Ghost: for his followers (as <hi>Eusebius</hi> writes) called him the <hi>Paraclete, i.</hi> the Comforter. Twas <hi>Manicheus</hi> his mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse too, <hi>Iewels</hi> Defence, <hi>Pag.</hi> 593. Nay, many have said, they have <hi>beene</hi> Christ, <hi>Christus hic, Christus illic:</hi> Christs selfe foretells it, there should arise <hi>false Christs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To end this; shall I finde you a man, that turnes my Text, inverts the termes of it, makes God mans mockage? <hi>Vorstius,</hi> that denies, that God is infinite, confines him to place, saith he hath a body, with many moe like blasphemies, cries in effect, <hi>Ecce,</hi> Behold, God is become like one
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:173124:165"/> of us. Indeede <hi>Tertullian</hi> gives God a body. He is no warrant to <hi>Vorstius.</hi> For he was not <hi>Homo Ecclaesiae,</hi> Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> saith, a <hi>Doctor,</hi> but not Orthodox: and yet he meant not neither so grossely, as the <hi>Vorstian.</hi> Leave wee the Persons compared: come to the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison.</p>
            <p>The Comparative Note is small, <hi>As</hi> one of us; but one syllable, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> scarce so much in the Originall; small in sound, great in sense; <hi>as</hi> one of us, makes man Gods equall. Comparisons are odious, we say: this is. There is lawfull comparison; compare with God, man may: some way, so we remember <hi>Iosuahs</hi> lesson, <hi>Da gloriam Deo, Give God the excellencie. Are we stronger than he?</hi> saith Saint <hi>Paul▪</hi> Man and God there compared; but God prefer'd. Put man under and after God, compare and spare not. But <hi>Sicut</hi> is absurd betweene them two. <hi>Caesarve priorem, Pompeiusve parem.</hi>—God suffers neither Superiour, nor Peere; vouchsafes man many lovely names, his Ioy, his Iewell, his Sonnes, his Saints; but not his Peeres. Yet finde I <hi>Abraham</hi> call'd Gods <hi>Friend,</hi> Saint <hi>Iames</hi> so stiles him, Gods selfe doth, <hi>Esay</hi> 41. and Friends are Peeres. They are meant properly. But <hi>Abraham</hi> is called so, <hi>Ob cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatem,</hi> not <hi>ob Paritatem,</hi> for the qualitie of his love, not for the equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of estate. The Kings friend, Scripture hath oft; that is, his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, not his equall. Kings have no Peeres. Their Nobles are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Pares,</hi> but thats <hi>inter se,</hi> Peeres one to another, not to the King▪ they are all his subjects.

            <p>Nay, why not <hi>Sicut</hi> too, in sober sense? What needs this <hi>Ironie?</hi> Man is indeed like God. <hi>Moses</hi> saith it in sad sooth, <hi>In the Image of God created he them.</hi> Gods selfe saith it too, saith it seriously, not <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

            <p>Indeed Man is not Gods Image, as Christ was Gods lively Image, <hi>Heb. 1. 3. The expresse Image of his Person.</hi> Christ was so, as his Sonne; not as Man, but as the Word.

            </p>
            <p>First for the act, tis odious, but assiduous. Curses are common in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> mens mouthes, mens, and womans; childrens too. Of them, and oathes, streets, all places ring. What fearefull execrations, direfull impreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may every care heare every where? should not God shorten those dayes, saith Christ, no flesh should be saved. Surely, should not God shut his cares against curses, no soules would be saved. The whole earth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> had long since beene carryed headlong into hell. So frequent is the <hi>act,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>For the act, men curse not onely in extremities, extremitie of wrong, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> or paine. That impatiencie were more pardonable. Orphans or Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes opprest, if they curse, tis no marvaile; or any one unjustly vext: tis in the bitternes of their soule. That the damned ghosts in hell blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme <hi>God</hi> in their torture, as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> writes in the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> tis not strange neither.

<pb n="299" facs="tcp:173124:167"/> no extortioner, hee saith. But they all will curse upon occasion. <hi>Non est homo, qui non peccet,</hi> saith <hi>Salomon,</hi> theres no man but sinnes thus sometimes. From the tallest Cedar to the lowest shrubbes. Theres not one can pleade Not-guilty. The poore curse the rich; the rich re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite them. Masters their servants, servants them. Every man his neighbour. No bond can binde from this; not law, not love, not alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, not religion. Lawes least of all; men set them light. Love does not. Fathers have curst their sonnes, <hi>Oedipus</hi> doth in the tragedie. Mothers have, <hi>Michahs</hi> mother, <hi>Iud.</hi> 17. Nor allegiance; <hi>Curse not the King,</hi> saith <hi>Salomon.</hi> But <hi>Shimei</hi> did, curst <hi>David</hi> with an horrible curse. Religion doth not, which hath the name of binding, <hi>à religando.</hi> Not a man of <hi>Belial,</hi> but a man of God will curse under the Crosse. Paine will wrest a curse from a Saints mouth. Sathan, that great tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailour that (as he tells God here) had walkt throughout the world, had well observ'd it, bids God try if <hi>Iob</hi> would not curse him to his face, if hee afflicted him.

But at last extremitie opened his mouth, forc'st it open, and hee curst. <hi>Peter,</hi> Christs Disciple, (lest you may say, thats little, <hi>Iudas</hi> was so) <hi>Peter</hi> an Apostle, an holy Apostle, not in paine, but in passion, in his feare did <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

Malice wisheth evill, not to his neighbour onely; his wife, man or maidservant, but also to his house, to his Oxe, to his Asse, to any thing that is his. Mainely to his person; but yet also to his goods, which (as the Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men speake) are <hi>ordine ad proximum,</hi> their evill is his hurt.</p>
            <p>Cursing a wicked act, done 1. how soever, and 2. by whomsoever. For<note place="margin">α.</note> the former; haply in my curse I wish but little hurt, or it is of course, or in merriment, or light passion. I sinne the lesse; but yet I sinne, some say, venially. God keepe mee even from veniall sinne. But there is a man, <hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>loves</hi> cursing, whose mouth is full of it, who <hi>cloathes</hi> himselfe with it, the <hi>sonne</hi> of cursing, <hi>Peters</hi> terme.

But as Christ saith of swearing, sister to this sinne, <hi>sweare not at all:</hi> so would the Apostle bee constered in this too, <hi>Noli maledicere, Curse not,</hi> saith <hi>Paul, curse not at all.</hi> Not habit onely is forbidden, but Act too.

<pb n="300" facs="tcp:173124:168"/> much, as nam'd.</hi> The terme hatefull, not the thing onely. <hi>Maledictio, mala dictio,</hi> a religious eare abhorres the very word. The holy tongue so hates it, that it hides and heales the malice of it under a terme of quite contrary sense; shunnes the proper word, uses the opposite, blesse for curse. As <hi>Greekes</hi> call the <hi>Furies, Eumenides, i.</hi> gentle, and <hi>Latines</hi> the <hi>Destinies, Parcas, i.</hi> favourable, by the figure <hi>Euphemismus.</hi> As good manners let us not, to Persons of respect, to call some homely thing by the owne proper terme: so Sathan in this <hi>Chapter,</hi> and the first, spea. king to God, dares not name this thing, but by the contrary; the 11. <hi>verse</hi> of the first <hi>Chapter,</hi> and the 5. of this, <hi>See if he will not blesse thee to thy face.</hi> Tis not so in your Bookes, because the English beares it not: but tis so in the Originall. Cursing, a terme so course, that the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Spirit names it not. Thats for howsoever.</p>
            <p>Now for, By Whomsoever. Curse, All men doe; none should. <note place="margin">β,</note>
               <hi>Iobs</hi> selfe the paterne paramont of all patience, you heard, he did. <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie</hi> did, a Prophet, 20. 15. No Man should, Man nor Angell. <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael</hi> would not, an Arch-angell, would not curse Sathan; said, <hi>but the Lord rebuke thee.</hi> Cursing is one kind of private revenge. The Law forbids that, Gods Law, and Mans too. Be my wrong nere so great; I may not curse. I usurpe upon Gods Office. <hi>Mihi vindicta, Vengeance</hi> (saith God) <hi>is mine.</hi> God and the Magistrate, Gods Lievetenant must revenge my wrong; my selfe must not. Nay, if I curse, I doe worse. I usurpe not onely, I am more absurd, then so. I make my selfe a Iudge, and God my Executioner. To end this, <hi>Dirae,</hi> be <hi>Dei irae,</hi> the evill which I wish must come from God. Hee onely may curse, who can execute the Curse. That can God onely. <hi>Solus dominator, solus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minator, Tertullian.</hi> God hath made our mouthes to Blesse, not to curse with them. And God hath made us Men, not Serpents, to spit poison.</p>
            <p>Now lest I be too peremptory, I must admit some cases, in which men may curse. Schoolemen make three kindes of curses, <hi>Indicative, Imperative, Optative.</hi> The first concernes us not, tis Obtrectation, Rayling, and Reviling. Thats <hi>Maledictum,</hi> rather then <hi>Maledictio.</hi> The second, the Churches censure, excommunication; I may not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne it. Theres an old Curser at <hi>Rome</hi> uses it much, abuses it much. Tis lawfull, used aright. For it is not Mans, but Gods. Thats <hi>Parer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon</hi> heere too. My theme is the curse <hi>Optative,</hi> one mans wishing mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, any evill to another. This hitherto we have censured, and made no exception: now we must. Else should the lawfull actions of Gods Prophets, and his Priests, of the Patriarks, and Apostles, and other godly men be condemned promiscuously. Yea and a great part of the holy Booke of <hi>Psalmes</hi> be put out of the Bible, as ungodly and uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable.</p>
            <p>For what say we to righteous <hi>Noah,</hi> who cursed his grand sonne, <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledictus puer Chanaan?</hi> What to <hi>Isaacks</hi> speech to <hi>Iacob, Cursed be they that curse thee?</hi> and what to <hi>Jacobs</hi> curse on <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi?</hi> The Priests Curse on the woman suspected of adultery, that <hi>her thigh should rot, and her belly burst?</hi> What to <hi>Ioshua,</hi> and <hi>Ionathan;</hi> but to <hi>David</hi> above all? Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> shall answer it; he speakes of <hi>David</hi> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:173124:168"/> but it will serve for all, <hi>Non optando dicit, sed prophetando praedicit,</hi> they prophesie, they curse not, they wish no evill, but foretell it. But what to <hi>Elias</hi> and <hi>Elisha;</hi> the one cursed the two Captaines with their fifties; the other the Boies of <hi>Bethel,</hi> The Text answers for the one; twill serve for both, it was <hi>In the name of the Lord.</hi> So did <hi>Peter Simon Magus, thy money perish with thee;</hi> and others more in holy Scripture. And so is the Curse of excommunication, <hi>In nomine Domini,</hi> ever in Gods name.</p>
            <p>These Execrations warrantable all. Heare another, lawfull too. By which in the cause of my Country, or Religion, I wish misfortune to the Enemy. To any that shall attempt to hurt either, I will make no scruple to wish a Bridle in his lippes, and a Hooke in his nostrils. I will not say with <hi>Paul, Vtinam exscindantur;</hi> but I will say with <hi>David, uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam confundantur, Let them be confounded that beare evill will to Sion.</hi> Out of these, and like cases, cursing is unchristian, and accurst of God. He that loves it, it shall light on him, saith the <hi>Psalme. It shall come like water into his bowels, and like oyle into his bones.</hi> Tis time I leave the Act.</p>
            <p>Heare now the Object. Twere well yet, if wickednesse would be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> bounded here; if malice would but curse his Peeres, one man another, and stay there. But sinne will be superlative, out of measure sinnefull: Man will curse <hi>God.</hi> Paine may moove passion, and misery haply cast forth a curse. <hi>Dinah</hi> might yet have counseld her husband to curse Sathan. Twas he, wrought all the mischiefe, burnt his Sheepe, slew his Children, plagued Himselfe. Or he might have curst the <hi>Chaldees</hi> and <hi>Sabeans,</hi> that had carried away his cattell. Many will doe so; curse their oppressours: and no more. <hi>Dinah</hi> thought that simplicity, with the dog, to bite the stone, and leave the caster. Shee knew, Sathan and men were but Gods instruments. She had heard her husband make God authour of all, <hi>Dominus dedit, dominus abstulit.</hi> He shall not be so silly, to curse Sathan: he shall set his mouth even against Heaven, and curse Gods selfe.</p>

            <p>God to curse man, thats just. For to sinne belongs a curse. Christs selfe, Gods Sonne, taking our sinnes on him, became a curse, <hi>Paul</hi> saith.

God had sore smitten him: yet still hee praises God, cries <hi>Benedictus,</hi> not <hi>Maledictus.</hi> Yea so great is his patience, and his faith so strong that hee cryes out afterward, <hi>Though God shall slay mee, yet will I trust in him.</hi> Peace <hi>Eve,</hi> cease Sathan; you have not <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> heere.

Life is sweete, but not in paine. Death is welcome in affliction. <hi>Ionas</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> Prophets both, prayed they might dye. But must desire of death induce mee to curse God? God may restore mee: he did <hi>Iob.</hi> Say he will not; yet must I doe no act against my life. <hi>Iob</hi> calls his friends, <hi>miserable comforters:</hi> well may hee call his wife a miserable counsellour. Men give sometimes a medicine worse then the disease. Shee does here. To ease paine, shee prescribes sinne. Shee deemes his fittest Physicke, death. The readiest way to it, is to curse God. That sinne shee thought God would judge instantly; would strike him, if hee curst with present death. As if she should have sayd, pray never so much; God will not take thy life, and so ease thee for thy piety. Curse God, and force him to kill thee for thy blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie.</p>
            <p>Tis marvaile shee mooves him not to slay himselfe: thats no lesse sinne of the two. Discontent is oft desperate, is tempted easily to selfe murther. The devill in distresse tempts many so; <hi>Ecce funem, ecce aquam:</hi> will himselfe offer them, a cord, a knife; bid strangle, drowne, or stabbe themselves. <hi>Iobs</hi> wife doth worse; bids him <hi>curse God.</hi> So hee shall stabbe <hi>God, Levit.</hi> 24. 11. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

Moses</hi> calls <hi>Eve,</hi> the <hi>mother of all living:</hi> surely God is the Father of all living; breathed life first into man. Death came by the devill; is his tooth, <hi>Mors</hi> (saith Saint <hi>Aug.) a mordendo,</hi> is himselfe, <hi>Mors diabolus</hi> Death is the devill, saith the same Father; plaies the devill at least, is that <hi>Abaddon</hi> in the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> destroyes all men. Yet God sends death, first threatend it to sinne, then inflicted it for sinne. <hi>God sent</hi> (saith the <hi>Psalmist) evill Angels among them:</hi> Death was one of them. He is therefore said to
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:173124:171"/> kill. Though he will not death; <hi>Nolo mortem,</hi> saith God, that is hee takes no joy in it; yet hee sends it for sinne. Though he delight in life, quickens all things, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith; Life his kindest and most proper Act; yet he kills too, both <hi>Vivificat &amp; mortificat, Hannah</hi> saith in her song. Gods selfe saith, <hi>I give life, and I kill, Deut.</hi> 32. God slew <hi>Iudahs</hi> two sonnes, <hi>Onan</hi> and <hi>Er,</hi> would have kill'd <hi>Moses, Exod. 4.

            <p>Come to <hi>Iobs</hi> confidence; thats more questionable. <hi>Iob</hi> a Gentile trust on God? An <hi>Edomite,</hi> one of wicked <hi>Esaus</hi> posteritie? Why not?

               <hi>You have heard</hi> (saith S. <hi>Iames) of the patience of Iob:</hi> you shall see it here and his trust on God together. It pleases God for our exercise and triall, exercise of our patience, and trial of our trust on him, oftentimes to crosse and afflict his dearest children. He is pleased most times to censure them for sin. Why say I pleased? It is no joy to him: he is forc't to punish them. Yet not to punish neither; theres no punishment to the righteous. It is <hi>Monitio,</hi> not <hi>Punitio,</hi> chastisement, not punishment; he but chastens his children. But his crosses often are meerely meant to trie them. The triall oft so sharpe that a godly man for it shall be reckond for a sinner; to have done some grievous, hainous, extraordinary sinne. Tis <hi>Iobs</hi> case; his friends observing the strangenesse of his Crosse, thought him a wicked man, not thought onely, but flatly pronounc't him a transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sour.

God fells him to ground, doth it <hi>Septies,</hi> often, to day, to morrow, every day, <hi>seaven times in one day;</hi> fells him not onely; bruises him, wounds him, maimes him; more, hazards his life; hazards it? Happly kills him right out. <hi>Thou hast thrust sore at me,</hi> saith <hi>David;</hi> Gods arrowes stucke in him; <hi>David</hi> an other <hi>Iob.</hi> But <hi>Davids</hi> afflictions were but some of them for triall, most were for his sinnes. Gods crosses are my theme, such as Sathans owne wit could not invent worse, the devills devise all, his head and hand in all. <hi>En, quicquid ejus est, in tua manu est;</hi> all that <hi>Iob</hi> had, God permitted to his mercy; mercilesse destroyer. <hi>Iob</hi> indeed saith, God did it all, cries <hi>Dominus abstulit,</hi> Thats true too; God did, but by the devill.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iob</hi> was the greatest man in all the East countries, the <hi>Greeke</hi> Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours say, for Birth, the <hi>Paraphrast,</hi> for Wealth; had 7000. sheepe,

God had blest him too with children, seven sonnes and three daughters, all growne up, and stated; every one had his house: and, which must be a great joy, and comfort to their Father, all loving one another. This mans faith God will prove, will trie his trust on him. God knew it well enough; for he told it Sathan, told it him twice, <hi>Seest thou not my servant Iob?</hi> But he will have both him, and all men know it in all ages. Christians did in Saint <hi>Iames</hi> time, <hi>Audisti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>▪ ye have heard of it;</hi> and you (beloved) here <hi>Auditis,</hi> heare it now. Twas knowne to God before (Saint <hi>Ierom</hi> saith) <hi>Intrinsecus,</hi> knowne privately, <hi>Soli Deo, sibique, Greg.</hi> to God, and himselfe onely. But God will have the world to take notice of it too.</p>
            <p>First, his Oxen and Asses the <hi>Sabeans</hi> tooke by violence, and slew his servants, all save him onely that brings word of it. Before he could tell this, comes newes, that fire from heaven had burnt his sheepe. While that was telling, other newes, that the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> had driven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his Camels. In the middes of it, that a tempest had overthrowne the house, where his sonnes and daughters were, and slaine them all. Oxen, Sheepe, Camels, Servants, all hee had, his deare children too; lost at once, in one day, in one houre. His beasts by Robbery, that skilled lesse; twas but mans malice; and his Sheepe by lightening, more tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable too, the devills worke; we use to say, theres a Feend in such foule weather. But his children unkindly by Gods hand; God is against him too. Fire from Heaven, Winde from the Earth, Theeves from the Borders, Sathan from Hell; Heaven, Earth, and Hell; Men, Devills, and Gods selfe, had in a sort conspir'd against him.</p>
            <p>Poore <hi>Iob,</hi> distressed, miserable man, what saith he to all this? Even what the meekest man on earth, <hi>Moses</hi> selfe, could not have mended, <hi>Dominus dedit, Dominus abstulit, The Lord hath given, and the Lord hath taken away.</hi> Cries <hi>Paul, O Altitudo!</hi> Let me, <hi>O mansuetudo!</hi> O admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable meekenesse! Nay, not meekely onely; sweetly too, divinely; the voice of an Angell, rather than a man, cries <hi>Halleluja,</hi> thankes God for afflicting him, <hi>Blessed be the name of the Lord.</hi> Wee crie <hi>Benedictus Deus in donis suis,</hi> blesse God when he blesseth us. But who cries <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictus Deus in poenis suis,</hi> blesses God when he curseth us? <hi>Benedictus</hi> is in every mouth for receipt; looke if for losse there be one in all the Scripture.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iob</hi> here hath dueld with the devill, <hi>Impar congressus,</hi> but is Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour; is more. His first speech, <hi>Dominus dedit,</hi> makes him that, his hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble acknowledgement, that hee had all from God. But his <hi>Benedictus,</hi> to thanke and praise God for taking all away, this is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Pauls</hi> terme, makes him more than a Conquerour. It would have done the devill good, if he would but have said, The Lord hath given, and the devill hath taken away. That had beene a confession of some power in him. <hi>Iob</hi> would not honour Sathan so, knew, he does nought, but what God lets him; ascribes that to God too, <hi>Dominus abstulit.</hi> That con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit vext Sathan. But if <hi>Iob</hi> in that conceit would therefore have curst God; that would have made amends. But to praise God for it too, that was <hi>Diaboli Gorgon,</hi> it astonied him; a <hi>Vade Satan,</hi> he endures it not, gets him gone, gone for that time.</p>
            <pb n="308" facs="tcp:173124:172"/>
            <p>But the devill hath not done; hee hath spent his spight in vaine; will moove God, if he may, to try <hi>Iob</hi> further. So God does; but to Sathans further foyle, and <hi>Iobs</hi> rich reward at the trials end. Sathan had said, let God touch all, <hi>Iob</hi> had; he would blaspheme, would curse God to his face. <hi>Iob</hi> hath prooved him a lyer, <hi>&amp; adhuc,</hi> saith God, thou hast mooved me to destroy him; yet he stands fast, and trusts in me still. That tryall therefore Sathan slights, though his owne motion, <hi>Skinne for skinne.</hi> The malitious spirit extenuates <hi>Iobs</hi> patience; saith, to escape a greater mischiefe, a man will beare a lesse; will part with all he hath, to save himselfe. The merchant in a tempest, will cast out all his fraight, rather then drowne. Who to save his life, will not lose his goods? Children, and all; shift they for themselves; he will save one.</p>
            <p>Must I dispute (I would not) with the devill? His Argument is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther true, nor pertinent. <hi>Skinne for skinne?</hi> tis false, I will redeeme my Sonnes death with mine owne. The brute creature will. <hi>Iob</hi> would have dyed (I doubt not) to have saved his Childrens lives. <hi>David</hi> had a dozen, would for one, a bad one too, yet he cryed out, <hi>Oh Absa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, my Sonne, my Sonne Absalon, would God I had dyed for thee, Oh Absalon, my Sonne, my sonne.</hi> The Midwife haply in hard birth, lets the Child dye, to save the Mother. But I count it not a Child, till it be borne: nor will haply the mother thanke her for her paines. It is true (<hi>quadam—tenus, Skinne for skinne.</hi> One will hold out his arme, to guard his head; cut off one rotting member, to save all. But a Parent will lose all for a Sonne, a mother specially. Secondly, <hi>Skinne for skinne,</hi> Sathan argues idlely, speakes not to the point. A man will give all that he hath for his life? <hi>Iobs</hi> life was not in question, life nor limme. God had forbidden he should touch his Person. But that Sathan (they say) is blacke, he should blush to reason so, nothing to purpose.</p>
            <p>Leave his Reason, heare his motion, a second motion, more mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious then the first, <hi>Touch his bones, and his flesh:</hi> prayes God, enlarge his license. They before were excepted. Now God grants that too, is pleased to try <hi>Iobs</hi> patience so. Sathans second Onset, hath leave (saving his life) to doe his worst. Fire and Water (we say) have no mercy; we may sweare, Sathan hath not. Christ told his Disciples, Sathan sought to winnow them. Here he will <hi>Iob,</hi> and try him tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly. Poore man; he must to the Fanne, to the Furnace againe.

And that on a base couch; in ashes, thats the best: the vulgar Latine saith, <hi>In ster quilinio, on a dunghill.</hi>

            <p>Oh the cruelty of Sathan! Oh the patience of <hi>Iob!</hi> Nay, shall I dare cry out, Oh the patience of God! that would suffer his Servant, a just man, that feared God, and shunned all evill, to be throwne downe so indignely, from such highth of honour, to such depth of shame; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Hath the devill yet done with him? Hee hath not. That which is worse, then all this, might vexe <hi>Iobs</hi> soule yet more, his Wife, who should be his comfort in such case, turnes devill too; tempts him to despaire, bids in the devils <hi>dialect, Curse God, and Dye.</hi> Never (I thinke) before, had man to any woman, woman to any man spoken so wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. What saith <hi>Iob</hi> to all this? Nothing a great while; <hi>Curae leves loquuntur,</hi> is not patient onely, Silent too; till his wives wickednesse forced him to speake, to speake, to rebuke blasphemy; Silent else. Strange strength; paine will make <hi>Hercules</hi> cry. But in his speech to her, he showes his Faith, that for all his torment, yet he trusts in God. <hi>Shall we receive good,</hi> saith he, <hi>and not evill at Gods hand?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well might his wife say to him, <hi>he continued in his righteousnesse,</hi> he does more, proceeds in it; <hi>justus ante,</hi> saith <hi>Gregory, post flagella justior;</hi> he was just before his triall, is more just now, holds it equity, God should send us soure things, as well as sweete. <hi>Gregory</hi> bids note two things for our comfort in afflictions, <hi>Quales &amp; Quantae,</hi> their number, and their waight. If they be grievous, they be lightly few, if many, they be light. <hi>Iobs</hi> are both great and many; and yet is not discouraged, trusts still in God. The tenth part of his misery would have made a man despaire, another man; <hi>Iob</hi> does not. Sathan his Combatant hath once met with his match, with more, is overmatcht. <hi>Iob</hi> hath foild him againe. In wealth, in losse, in health, in sores, is <hi>semper idem,</hi> changes not, still a truster in God.</p>
            <p>Let me not yet lye, to honour <hi>Iob;</hi> I must not quit him quite from all impatiency. He was (as God saith) <hi>a just man,</hi> but a man. As <hi>Eve</hi> was in his wife, she tempted him: so <hi>Adam</hi> was in him, flesh and blood, some infirmity. Extreame paines, and long sorrow, provokt besides by his upbraiding friends, miserable comforters, made him sometimes forget himselfe a little, and speake (as <hi>Moses</hi> did once too) unadvisedly. The holiest Saint on earth hath trespast so; well, if not worse. But hitherto I am warranted to justifie <hi>Iob; in all this, Iob sinned not,</hi> saith <hi>God. 2. 10. Nec loquens, nec tacens, Augustine,</hi> neither si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, nor in speech; neither in word, nor deed, saith <hi>Gregory.</hi> In the first triall, poore in state, but <hi>Corde ditissimus,</hi> rich in heart, <hi>August.</hi> in the latter, <hi>foris putrescens, sanus intus,</hi> though sore in body, sound in soule. He stood like a towre, one writer termes him so; not all the devils battery could shake his faith. God to seeming forsooke him, <hi>used him,</hi> (hee saith) <hi>as an enemy.</hi> Yet in his trust he cries, <hi>Post te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nebras spero lucem,</hi> after all those overcasts, hee lookt to see againe the light of Gods countenance. God thrusts sore at <hi>Iob;</hi> but <hi>Iob</hi> trusts still on God.</p>
            <p>God will trie <hi>Iob</hi> no further; Sathan dares moove him no more. He sees, it bootes not. The oftner the gold comes to the fire, it is the finer. Sathan but refines <hi>Iob.</hi> Two motions he had made; the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed tempter cald them but touches both. Touch all he hath; and, touch his bones and flesh. Man may cry to Sathan, <hi>Noli me tangere,</hi> touch me not, needs pray to God he may not. The devils touch is destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Iobs</hi> substance, servants, and children perisht by his touch; his bones and flesh consumed by it. His life had too, had not God excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:173124:173"/> it, bidden him save it. Sathan bidden to save? Thats no Act for him: he is <hi>Abaddon,</hi> the destroyer. Had not Gods selfe preserved <hi>Iobs</hi> life; Sathan would have toucht it too. What if God had let Sathan kill him too? Yet even that too notwithstanding, holy <hi>Iob</hi> would <hi>Trust</hi> on him.</p>
            <p>I presume, you looke to have that proved; Is it not my Text? Else (you will happly say) I have done nothing. I pray, you will trust <hi>Iob;</hi> you may, a just man. Yet tis the Preachers part to prove his Text. The proofe hard, because God tried not <hi>Iob</hi> so farre; he killd him not. But <hi>Iobs</hi> constancie in the trials, you have heard, thats proofe enough. They were more bitter than death. Had God kild <hi>

                  </gap>ob</hi> outright, he had done lesse to him, than he did to him. But (by your learned leaves) I should but <hi>Actum agere,</hi> to prove this point: It is done already. <hi>Iob</hi> meanes the terme in Metaphor. Gods heavy hand on him, in his losse of state and children, and his tormenting paines, he calls Gods killing him.</p>
            <p>A mans state is called his life. The poore widow in the Gospell cast into the Treasurie <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

The anguish of his sores, they innumerable, it unsuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable, was a death worse than the former. It made him (like Saint <hi>Paul</hi>) to <hi>Die daily.</hi> In paines (saith the Tragicke) <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, life is not life, tis death; tis worse than death, God kild <hi>Iob</hi> so. Yet he dispaires not, remaines still in his righteousnesse. Here was <hi>Gladius, gladius,</hi> the Prophet doubles it, <hi>Duplicetur,</hi> saith <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> his goods, his children, his owne person, <hi>Triplicetur,</hi> saith the Prophet, God kills him thrice. Yet he despaires not, trusts on God for all this, <hi>Though he kill me; I will trust on him.</hi> A generous, magnanimous, heroicall resolution, worthy of an <hi>Ecce,</hi> a <hi>Behold,</hi> to goe before it: and so there doth in some Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations. The <hi>Genevah</hi> hath it, and our last had had it too, (for it is in the Originall) but that it was thought fit to turne it otherwise, to be made a particle, not demonstrative, but discretive. It deserves and needs an <hi>Ecce,</hi> deserves for <hi>Iob,</hi> needs one for us. For we are <hi>Iobs,</hi> all of us; whether rich or poore; for he was both at times. But we doe, as <hi>Job,</hi> few of us. He both in wealth and want trusted on God; most of us in neither. The man of wealth saith to the wedge of gold, <hi>Thou art my confidence.</hi> The poore man saith, I will steale rather than starve. Am I betweene both? Yet I trust not in God. Be my Condition, Magistra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, Iudicature, Trafficke, or Trade, Office, or Handy-craft: I will lie and sweare falsely, bribe actively and passively, cheat and extort, use Covin and Ravin, and unrighteously corrade much Mammon of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, to leave my Sonnes Lands, and raise my Daughters Portions. Will the Preacher presse me with <hi>Deus providebit,</hi> God will provide
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:173124:173"/> for them? I will not trust to that. Will he say, God will curse my evill gotten goods? My children shall waste them, and they shall corrupt my children?

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have here once before treated of <hi>Iobs</hi> faith, his confidence, his admirable <hi>confidence on God,</hi> that though he <hi>kild him,</hi> he would <hi>trust on him.</hi> Here I finde his faith againe; but on another object. And as the former hath, so hath this, a <hi>Tamen</hi> too, another <hi>Nihilominus:</hi> there, <hi>though the Lord slay me, yet will I trust on him:</hi> here, <hi>though the wormes consume mee: yet shall I see God in my flesh.</hi> My theme is one maine Article of the Christian Creed, <hi>the resurrection of the dead.</hi> It is my Text but <hi>in Hypothesi, Iob</hi> speaks but of himselfe. But <hi>ex uno disce omnes,</hi> it is the case of all mankind. <hi>Iob</hi> saith but <hi>I;</hi> but Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith <hi>All;</hi> saith it twice, to the <hi>Corinth. All must;</hi> to the <hi>Romans, All shall.</hi> Here are foure severall termes; an act, to <hi>See;</hi> the Seer, <hi>Iob;</hi> the object, <hi>God; I shall see God;</hi> the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the <hi>Eye:</hi> not the soules Eye: the understanding; but the bodies <hi>In my flesh. In my flesh shall I see God.</hi> Of each breefly in order.</p>
            <p>But first the termes must give a little leave to the note of connexion, <hi>Yet.</hi> A little word, but one syllable, but one letter in the Hebrew, but as materiall as the termes. Shall <hi>Iobs</hi> skinne, his whole body, rot, haply alive, certainly in grave, the wormes eate all? and yet he <hi>see God in his flesh?</hi> Flesh, skinne, bones too, all turn'd to dust, to nought, yet shall <hi>Iob</hi> behold God? So hee saith <hi>ver. prox.</hi> With his <hi>eyes,</hi> hee
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:173124:174"/> having none? What ailes <hi>Iob</hi> to speake thus? Sathan by Gods licence had twice toucht him, in his body and in his goods. Hath hee toucht him in Braine too? that hee speakes Non-sense? For so hee seemes in the originall. The Hebrew will pose any learned man, to conster it; the words are so unperfit. The vulgar Latin makes one sense, the Seventy another; but both such, as the words will not beare.</p>
            <p>Or say <hi>Iobs</hi> meaning be, as our Service booke hath Englisht it out of the vulgar Latin, <hi>I shall rise out of the earth at the last day, and shall bee covered againe with my skinne, and shall see God in my flesh.</hi> Though the Hebrew meane not so; yet say, it doth: say that sounds to sense; but sounds it well to reason? Not the Atheist alone, but all gentiles will cry, <hi>Credat Iudaeus appella.</hi> The Corpse consumd to rise againe; beleeve who list; they will not. Nay, nor will the Iew neither, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Iew; the Saducee will not. The resurrection a grand <hi>Paradox.</hi> The wisest of the world (Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith) call it <hi>Stultum,</hi> a foolerie Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, not to bee beleeved. No point of Religion is gaine sayd <hi>Tam pertinaciter</hi> (Saint <hi>Augustines</hi> terme) so stiffely, so stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornely, as it. Wee shall finde the Philosophers yeeld the soules Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, though that too <hi>Haesitanter.</hi> But the resurrection they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Peremptoriè,</hi> cry, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, it is not. <hi>Post mortem nihil est,</hi> saith <hi>Seneca,</hi> all's done when a man's dead. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap> (saith the Greeke Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian) death is immortall; the dead never revive. The <hi>Athenians</hi> cald <hi>Paul,</hi> a babler, for avouching it, and the Iudge in open Session told him, he was mad.</p>
            <p>Wonder not at heathens, strangers to holy Scriptures; Christians have stumbled at this stone. Christs owne Disciples have; much adoe to make them beleeve, Christs selfe was risen; though they beleeved him to be God. Nay, Christs owne Vicar hath, Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> 23. Pope <hi>Paul</hi> 3. too. But Hereticks infinite, even from the Churches infancie, unto our age, have discreeded this Article, the <hi>Marcionite,</hi> the <hi>Manichee,</hi> 12. severall sorts I could rehearse to you. The Libertines and Anabaptists doe now. But though it be <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

Enough of the Note; Is it not a little one?</p>
            <p>Of the foure termes, the person is the first, <hi>I shall see; Iob</hi> shall. A<note place="margin">α.</note> second Absurditie. Grant a Resurrection, at which man shall see God.

               </gap>, saith <hi>Iustin Martyr,</hi> multitude of gods is irreligion; God (saith <hi>Moses</hi>) is one.

The vulgar Latin Bible hath it so: and the Councill of <hi>Trent</hi> will have <hi>it</hi> to over-rule. Were not this
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:173124:175"/> but an Obiter, I would hope to accord the controversie. But be it so translated; yet that the wicked shall not therefore rise againe at the last day, no papist will say, <hi>David</hi> meant. The Fathers expound it diversely; but none so, save <hi>Lactantius.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> shall determine it; he said plainely before <hi>Felix,</hi> that the Resurrection should be both of Iust and Vnjust.</p>
            <p>It is a meere Iewish conceipt, held by their <hi>Rabbines,</hi> that the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed shall not rise. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> their Soules shall perish with their Bodyes. But grant that too; yet <hi>Iobs</hi> shall not; he shall rise and see God. For though <hi>Iob</hi> came of <hi>Esau,</hi> which yet <hi>Broughton</hi> a great Hebrician denies, must he be therefore wicked, because his Father, his Grandfather was? No man will reason so. Then might <hi>Iob</hi> be lust, though sprong from <hi>Esau.</hi> Why say I, might? he was. See his Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall in the first verse of his history, <hi>an upright and Iust man, that feared God, and eschewed evill,</hi> Gods selfe subscribes it, saith it twice. The devill himselfe, called devill of accusing, could not gainesay it. Why then should not <hi>Iob</hi> cry in his holy faith, <hi>I shall see God?</hi> Gods owne Sonne saith in the Gospell, <hi>Beati mundi-cordes, the pure in heart shall see God,</hi> But that sight <hi>Iob</hi> meanes not, the <hi>Visio beatifica,</hi> proper to the Saints; <hi>Summum praemium; Augustine,</hi> Gods richest reward, and the highth of all felicity in Heaven. The Privation whereof exceeds (Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> saith) the paines of hell. Yea <hi>Chrysostom</hi> saith more, <hi>Mille Gehennas,</hi> a paine more heavy, then a thousand hels. But <hi>Iob</hi> meanes haply here, but the generall sight of God, common to all the dead. All that rise shall see God, God the Sonne, the Iudge. The Prophet saith it, <hi>They shall see him, whom they pierced.</hi> Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> saith, <hi>Apoc. Every eye shall see him. Iob</hi> (I thinke) meanes no more, then his Resurrection, not his Glorification. More of this (if I may) af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward.</p>
            <p>I should not greatly presse the Person here, my Text suppressing it, couching it onely in the <hi>verbe,</hi> but that the next verse expresses it, presses it too with great <hi>Emphasis,</hi> unexpressible in the <hi>English.</hi> Not barely, <hi>I,</hi> but <hi>I my selfe.</hi> Theres more in the Originall: yea and the Translation hath more too <hi>I my selfe, &amp; non Alius, not another,</hi> but my very selfe. <hi>Ego, ipse ego, non alius.</hi> Shall I now pray your more speciall attention, to some matter offered here, not ordinarily obvious? Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the worlds Creation, never was worke of God so full of wonder, as the Resurrection that I muse not, that so many, rather mervaile, that no more made question of this <hi>Article.</hi> I will note but such as fit this terme, I my selfe, not another.</p>
            <p>A Corpse quite perished, not corrupted onely, <hi>Corruptio is in aliquid,</hi> but quite consumed to nought, to rise againe the same body, the very selfe same corpse, it was. Bury it; twill turne to dust: burne it, there will be ashes. Thus there are yet some <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, some reliques, some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines, toward a Renovation; All is not gone. Though Regresse in Privation, returne to former state be crosse to reason: yet Faith will hold it facill to God, to build anew the body out of those poore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines, to restore it againe to that it was. But <hi>ex nihilo nihil fit,</hi> to make a body againe out of meere nothing, Faith will stagger at that. God
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:173124:175"/> did not so at the Creation, had some matireals, <hi>Homo ab humo, made him (Moses</hi> saith) <hi>of dust.</hi> Say, I beleeve this too, that God can of nothing make a body. For he did more once, made <hi>Adams</hi> Soule of nought, does still, makes ours, all ours so too. Yet to make it the same body, the selfe same, it was before, an <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a man of little saith, will cry, as <hi>Thomas</hi> did, <hi>Non credam,</hi> he <hi>beleeves it not.</hi> Great is <hi>Iobs</hi> faith, that does. God can make new of old; thats but to repaire: or <hi>Magnum ex modico,</hi> much of a little, thats but to adde: <hi>Eves</hi> whole body of <hi>Adams</hi> single rib, God can renew, and multiply. But a thing utterly ended, altogether spent, perisht quite, clea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e consumed, to make it <hi>idem ens,</hi> that very <hi>indi viduum,</hi> it was before; great is <hi>Iobs</hi> faith, to beleeve that.</p>
            <p>But Faith need not goe so farre. Mans body is not quite consumed, utterly perisht, turned into nothing. Tis but resolved into his first ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials. Though we know not what, nor where; yet God doth. Be it devoured by beast, by fish, by foules; consumed by fire, or water: All is one. <hi>Vbicun que est, in deposito est, Tert.</hi> tis at Gods command; who keepes it, and will render <hi>Suum cuique,</hi> to every man his owne flesh at the Resurrection.</p>
            <p>Heathens here have put cases. One man in famine eates another: his flesh, that is eaten, turnes into his flesh, that eates him. When both shall rise; whether shall have that flesh, the eater, or hee, that was eaten? If the eater: then the other rises not the same man, hee was, is not <hi>ipse,</hi> but <hi>Alius.</hi> I answer, the man devoured shall have his flesh restored; the eater, his repaired; enough to make them againe the same individuals. A Child is borne abortive; he shall rise a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit man: what was wanting to full growth, God will supply. Hee is the same person for all that. Such a scruple to Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> that he suspended his judgement, whether Abortives rose or not. A decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit person, crookt with age, shall rise in the state of the body at the best. And so both Fathers, Schoolemen, all Divines, hold, All men shall; shall rise, the old man in that state of body, which he had in his best age; the Child in that state, which he should have had, had he lived to it. They ground it on that place of <hi>Paul, Ephes.</hi> 4. 13. that wee all shall have the measure of the full age of Christ. Late Divines (I know) expound that otherwise: I will not argue it. Christs age was three and thirty yeares. Thats <hi>Aetas consistens,</hi> the Physitians terme, the time of most strength and vigour of mans body.</p>
            <p>They adde, integrity, and sanity; no mame▪ or malady then; but release from all both deformity and infirmity. For Christ (saith <hi>Tert.</hi>) is not onely <hi>Carnis Resuscitator,</hi> but <hi>Redintegrator</hi> too, will make our bodies glorious, like his owne. I say not, all shall have this honour, but the Elect onely. Nor doth this hinder <hi>identity,</hi> all this: we shall be the same persons notwithstanding. The old man is the same man, which he was, when he was young. Men sicke, or whole, maimd or sound, are the same persons.</p>
            <p>To end this, there shall be change in <hi>Iob,</hi> great change in his exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalls, in his internalls too, his soules endowments; but it shall be the same <hi>Iob;</hi> not <hi>Alius,</hi> but <hi>idem; Alius in gloria,</hi> but <hi>idem in persona;</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:173124:176"/> in many accidents, but <hi>idem suppositum,</hi> substantially the same. The same soule; that no man questions: the same body too, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

Herod</hi> had slaine <hi>Iohn Baptist:</hi> after, hearing of Christ, though the lived againe in him. Then <hi>Iob</hi> here is deceived; his faith is false, if this be true. Hee shall see God, but <hi>Per alium,</hi> an other for him, not himselfe. Some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther body shall haply have his soule, and <hi>Iob</hi> must see God in that body.

Nay <hi>Iobs</hi> errour is worse yet; neither shall <hi>Iobs</hi> selfe see God, nor an other; neither <hi>ipse ego,</hi> nor <hi>Alius.</hi> No godly man shall; the wicked onely shall. For all the soules of the godly shift their bodies, the Iewes say. No just man shall see God. <hi>Abel</hi> (for example) dies. <hi>Seth</hi> (they say) hath his soule. At the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection <hi>Abel</hi> rises, but with a body onely; for his soule went to <hi>Seth.</hi> He is but one halfe of <hi>Abel;</hi> and so <hi>Abel</hi> sees not God. Or if his soule returne againe to him; then <hi>Seth</hi> will want a soule; and so not he neither shall see God. For the body can not see, without the soule; <hi>Mens videt,</hi> saith the Philosopher, tis the soule that sees, that heares, that does all things: the body w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Sentire est pati, Aristotle</hi> saith, Sense is Passion, not Act. Sight is<note place="margin">β. γ.</note> one. The bodies of the dead, of the righteous specially, shall have spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall endowments; one among others, Impassibilitie. How then shall they see? But that Impassibilitie excludes not Sense. Else the life of the Saints should not differ much from Sleepe. They shall not thirst, nor hunger, nor feele paine: from such passion they are freed, from all <hi>passio corruptiva,</hi> which may hurt or offend. Nor is Sense meere Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but Active <hi>Passivity,</hi> Sight especially. Besides, the flesh shall rise, both <hi>Omnis, ipsa &amp; integra,</hi> saith <hi>Tert.</hi> All, the same, and entire.

Yet because without them it is not <hi>Corpus integrum,</hi> it shall have them all. But above all other, the Eye, to see God. So <hi>Iob</hi> saith, he shall see
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:173124:176"/> God. See God? God is invisible. <hi>No man</hi> (Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> saith) <hi>hath seene God,</hi> seene him with Eye, the bodies Eye: with Faith, the soules Eye, many have. That the Fathers meane, that say, the Invisible God is seene Invisibly. Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> saith, None hath; but <hi>Iob</hi> saith, he <hi>shall:</hi> Shall see God, face to face in heaven. But that is <hi>Visio beatifica,</hi> proper to the Saints. But <hi>Paul</hi> saith more than <hi>Iohn,</hi> None either hath, or can see God, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. How then saith <hi>Iacob, I have seene God?</hi> How saith <hi>Moses,</hi> that He, and <hi>Aaron,</hi> with his sonnes, and seventie Elders did see God? <hi>Theodoret</hi> answers, <hi>Iacob</hi> saw God <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

Christ saith, they doe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 10. doe see his Fathers face. That meanes but Gods presence; for God hath no face, as man hath. Gods divine nature is Object to no Eie.

They could not pierce him as God. <hi>Iob</hi> shall see God in the man Christ. Christs selfe so consters it, <hi>Matth. 26. Iob</hi> meanes here but that sight which all shall see, that shall arise. By that sight of God, is meant but their appearance before the Sonne of God. How shall that be? <hi>Iob</hi> saith, <hi>In carne,</hi> in his flesh. That terme onely remaines.</p>
            <p>Theres <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, a Philosopher saith, <hi>Iamblicus,</hi> an eye in the soule: <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, you heard before, the soule hath sight. <hi>Iobs</hi> bodily Eye shall behold God. <hi>Iob,</hi> to declare, he beleeves the Resurrection, rests not in saying, he shall see God, but adds, <hi>In carne, in his flesh.</hi> Though bodies perish't utterly, never should rise; yet the soule having (as you have heare) an Eye, should see God at Christs comming. Had he said but barely, <hi>I shall seee God,</hi> he had borne no witnesse to the Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: he therefore adds here, <hi>In my flesh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Two old Arch heretickes earely opposed this, held that soules onely<note place="margin">δ</note> shall rise, bodies shall not, <hi>Manes</hi> and <hi>Marcion.</hi> The one madde, as his name sounds; the other called for it by <hi>Polycarpus, Satanae Primogenitus,</hi> the devills eldest sonne. This odious heresie antient Fathers oppugn'd, and almost all Christian Creeds evidently crosse it, confesse expresly the bodies resurrection. Both Greeke and Latine Fathers have writ large tracts of it; and the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> is ample in this argument. You heare him read at every buriall. That Chapter is a Sermon sufficient on this point. <hi>Tertullian</hi> termes the grave, <hi>Sequestratorium,</hi> a place of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questration onely for the body. Places of <hi>Sepulture</hi> the Greekes call <hi>Coemeteria,</hi> the Dorters of the dead; the bodies there but couch and sleep till the last day. The soules then shall resume them; they shall rise at the sound of the last Trumpe. For the Resurrection is the rising of the dead. Soules are immortall, can not be said to rise; the bodies only die. Christ will raise them, all mens bodies. The just he must; for of those whom God hath given him, he saith, he hath lost none. Hee hath in part, if their bodies rise not. He saith, <hi>Non quenquam,</hi> but <hi>Tertullian</hi> reads <hi>Non quicquam,</hi> not onely any person, but not any part. Hee will redeliver them both all, and whole. Their soules were but their halfe; should but they rise onely, there were losse. Christ should save but <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midium hominem,</hi> the halfe of man; which were <hi>Indignum Deo</hi> saith
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:173124:177"/> that Father, unbeseeming a Saviour. <hi>Soter,</hi> the most honourable of all Christs Epithets, implies both <hi>Salvum &amp; integrum,</hi> safe and sound.</p>
            <p>But besides Honour, Iustice craves it too, the flesh to rise, all flesh, be the dead, that own'd it, righteous, or ungodly. For shall the soules of Saints and sinners, the one be crown'd in heaven, the other damn'd in hell, without their bodies? The bodies having wrought, whether righteousnesse, or wickednesse, as well as the soules? the flesh, being <hi>particeps, In causa,</hi> not be so too <hi>In sententia?</hi> saith <hi>Tertullian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theres a cloud in Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> would be cleared, ere I end, a seeming contradiction. <hi>I shall see God</hi> (saith <hi>Iob) in my flesh. Flesh</hi> (saith <hi>Paul) and bloud shall not come into Gods Kingdome.</hi> The speeches seeme oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site, but are not. They differ somewhat in their termes, more in their sense. For termes, <hi>Iob</hi> saith, but flesh, Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> flesh and bloud: <hi>Iob,</hi> hath but sight of God, Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> inheritance of Gods Kingdome. For sense, <hi>Iob</hi> meanes the substance of flesh, Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> the qualitie. And <hi>Iob</hi> by seeing God, meanes but appearance before him, common to all men, Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> eternall life and glory, proper to the Saints, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> as well as <hi>Iob</hi> is for the Resurrection, spends almost a whole Chapter, the longest in all his Epistles upon it. <hi>Iob</hi> shall see God, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies it not. Though he were a Reprobate, not onely <hi>Esaues</hi> seed, but <hi>Esaues</hi> selfe; yet he should see God. But a Reprobate shall not come in heaven. And <hi>Iob</hi> shall see God in his flesh, that is, in his true body▪ but not in flesh and bloud, that is, in mortall corruptible flesh, but changed and made incorruptible. That it shall be in his flesh, in his owne, not in an others, that point was prest before. This place of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> I would not have held worthy the objecting; but that it stumbled even <hi>Origen</hi> one of the most learned of all the Fathers.</p>

               </gap> too; as well by speech, as actions. <hi>David</hi> in this
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:173124:178"/>
               <hi>Psalme</hi> hath both? But this onely in my Text is enough to try his title, the title of a foole.</p>
            <p>Fooles are rather faultie in superstition, then impiety. Hardly is one found that acknowledges not God, that doth not pray to him, and stand in awe of him, after his capacitie. Wisedome is more likely to make doubt of God: for it consulteth with reason, and with sense: and (as the Apostle saith) the things of God seeme foolishnesse to them. The old man in <hi>Aristophanes</hi> cries, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, O notable folly, to thinke there is a God. <hi>Primus in orbe Deos fecit timor,</hi> saith the Poet; it was feare, the fooles passion, superstitious feare, that first brought God into the world. Of those whom God calls, there are not many wise; it is the Apostles too. Nay, he hath a stranger <hi>Paradox,</hi> then all this, <hi>that hee that will be wise,</hi> wise to God, hee <hi>must bee a foole, 2 Cor.</hi> 3. How is it then that, Atheisme is here layd upon the foole?</p>
            <p>There is a child in yeares, and there is a child in manners, <hi>aetate &amp; moribus,</hi> saith <hi>Aristotle.</hi> So there is a foole: for fooles and children, both are called <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; there is a foole in wit, and there is a foole in life; <hi>stultus in scientia, &amp; stultus in conscientia,</hi> a witlesse and a gracelesse foole. The latter is worthy of the title as the first: both voyd of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; not of the facultie, but of the use. Yea the latter foole indeed the more kindly of the twaine. For the Sot would use his reason, if hee could; the sinner will not though hee may. It is not the naturall, but the morall foole, that <hi>David</hi> meanes, the wicked and ungracious person. For so is the sense of the originall terme. The ravishing of <hi>Dinah,</hi> and of the <hi>Levites</hi> wife, <hi>Amnons</hi> incestuous rape, <hi>Achans</hi> sacriledge, outragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and flagitious acts, are termed <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap> there, that is, a wicked man. <hi>Nabal,</hi> that was christned a Foole, is cald a man of <hi>Belial,</hi> that is, a wicked man. [<hi>Dixit imprudens in corde suo:</hi> the <hi>imprudens</hi> is <hi>impudens,</hi> not witlesse, but shamelesse.] So hath it pleased Gods spirit in Scripture phrase, to call sinne, <hi>Folie:</hi> and the wicked, <hi>Fooles:</hi> especially in the wisest booke that ever was writ, and by the wisest man that ever liv'd, the booke of <hi>Proverbs,</hi> where almost in every verse, the gracelesse sinner is instiled a foole. And indeede <hi>Theophilact</hi> saith very wisely, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, wickednesse is right folly; to sell our selves for slaves to a most imperious mistresse, and a most malitious lord, the Flesh and Sathan: to enjoy a short pleasure in this world by sinne, to endure eternall torment in the next world in Hell. Nay the Sot (saith <hi>Salomon) trahitur ad vincula,</hi> is drawne unto the stockes; but the sinner needes no haling; he runnes voluntary into bondage.</p>

               </gap>; Religion, it is wisedome: <hi>Insipientis est dicere, non est deus;</hi> it is the speech of a foole, to say there is no God. Nay <hi>David</hi> deales here mildly, in calling him a foole: in the 75. <hi>Psalme,</hi> he calls the wicked mad. <hi>Dixi insanis, I sayd unto the mad men.</hi> The retchlesse sinner is out of his wits. The <hi>prodigall</hi> child, the type of a loose libertine, is sayd, when he repented, <hi>to come unto himselfe,</hi> as if he were beside himselfe before. Nay I will say, the Atheist is worse then mad. Wee pitty, and wee pardon the mad man; because reason hath lost all rule of him. But this man doth <hi>insanire cum ratione,</hi> is mad, and yet hath reason. For he knowes God is, and yet thinketh hee is not. Hee doth <hi>credere contra fidem,</hi> saith S. <hi>Hilarie;</hi> his heart beleeves even against his faith. Hee cannot but confesse, there is a God; and yet saith <hi>in his heart, there is no God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This foole exceedes the Atheist. The Atheist saith simply, there is no God at all. Horrible impietie; but the fooles is worse. Better to deny God, then to blasphe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e God. The Atheist is odious: hee hath not so much Religion, as the Devill: for the Devill beleeves; yea hee doth more, hee beleeves not onely, but hee confesses too. The two things, which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith suffice unto salvation, <hi>to beleeve with the heart,</hi> and <hi>to confesse with the mouth,</hi> the Devill doth them both, and should be sav'd by them, but that his faith i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> equivocall, and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession forc't. <hi>Credit Deum,</hi> but not <hi>in Deum;</hi> he beleeves God is, but he beleeves not on him. And his confessing Christ is not of love, but of constraint. But the Atheist hath no faith, no not historicall faith. But the foole exceedes the Atheist: he grants God is, but an ignorant, an improvident, an unjust, an idle God. If God be reproached, it must be <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> it must be from the foole. Remember thy reproach, saith <hi>David</hi> unto God, from the foolish man, <hi>Psal.</hi> 74. Mee thinkes I should take the negative particle from God, with whom it sutes not, and transferre it to the foole; and say, <hi>non est insipiens,</hi> there is no such foole. Surely Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith upon this place, they were <hi>rarum genus hominum,</hi> it was hard to meete wit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

               </gap>ch. Belike that age, was honester then ours. I would I might not say, they are <hi>frequens genus hominum,</hi> to be met with every where. I will but take his tryall to detect them. <hi>Prodeant, qui male vivunt:</hi> let them come before you that live licentiously, lewd and lawlesse libertines; and you will say, as <hi>Leah</hi> sayd when shee bare <hi>Gad, venit exercitus, here comes a multitude,</hi> a shippe, a shoale of fooles. Of such fooles the world is full: if folly may bee argued by ungodlinesse, as both Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> and the Scriptures warrant us. I say, if wicked living may define a foole, then surely <hi>stultorum plena sunt omnia;</hi> Citie, Court, Country, Church and Common-wealth, all are full of them. The counterfeit Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite, the profest libertine, the Machiavellian statist are three of them.</p>
            <p>The Hypocrite makes Religion but his stalking horse, his heart de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies God. As he saith of man, <hi>Psal. 64. quis videbit, who shall see?</hi> so he saith of God, <hi>Psal. 94. non videbit, hee shall not see.</hi> And it is all one to say, God sees not, and God is not.</p>
            <p>The Libertine, that desperately plunges into sinne, into all sorts of it,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:173124:179"/> into all degrees of it, that impudently maintaines it, being done, and holds it sinne, to make conscience of sinne; though his tongue doe confesse God, Yet his heart saith, <hi>non Credo,</hi> I doe not beleeve.</p>
            <p>States-men hold it policy, for the peoples sake, to say, God is: they rule them the more easily. But their <hi>mixta prudentia,</hi> their motley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>policy, halfe Gods, and halfe Mans, showes their heart saith, God is not.</p>
            <p>It is time we leave the Person, and come unto the Act. What hath <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> this foole done? Surely nothing; he hath onely <hi>said.</hi> What hath he said? Nay nothing neither; he hath onely <hi>thought:</hi> for to <hi>say in heart,</hi> is but to thinke. There are two sorts of saying in the Scripture; one meant indeed so properly, the other but in trope; one by word of mouth, the other by thought of heart. You see the <hi>Psalmist</hi> meanes here the second sort. The bolt the foole here shoots, is atheisme: he makes no noise at the losse of it, as bowmen use; he drawes and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers closely, and stilly, out of sight, and without sound; he saith, <hi>God is not,</hi> but <hi>in heart.</hi> The heart hath a mouth; <hi>intus est os cordis,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> God, saith Saint <hi>Cyprian,</hi> is <hi>Cordis auditor,</hi> he heares the heart; then belike it hath some speech. When God said to <hi>Moses, quare clamas, why cryest thou?</hi> We finde no words he uttered: <hi>Silens auditor,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Gregory,</hi> he is heard, though saying nothing. There is a silent speech. <hi>Psal. 4. 4. Loquimeni, &amp; tacete, commune with your hearts,</hi> saith <hi>David, and be still.</hi> Speech is not the hearts action, no more then meditation is the mouthes. But sometime the heart and mouth exchange offices, <hi>Lingua mea meditabitur,</hi> saith <hi>David, Psalme 35. ult.</hi> there is <hi>Lingua meditans,</hi> a musing tongue; here is <hi>Cor loquens,</hi> a speaking heart. And to say the truth, the Philosopher saith well, it is the heart doth all things, <hi>mens videt, mens audit, mens loquitur.</hi> It is the heart, that speakes; the tongue is but the instrument, to give the sound. It is but the hearts <hi>Echo,</hi> to repeat the words after it. Except where the tongue doth runne before the wit, the heart doth dictate to the mouth; it suggests, what it shall say. The heart is the Soules he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rauld; looke what shee will have proclaimd, the heart reads it, and the mouth cries it. The tongue saith nought, but what the heart saith first. Nay in very deed, the truest and kindliest speech is the hearts. The tongue and lips are <hi>Jesuites,</hi> they lease, and lie, and use equivoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: [flattery or feare, or other by-respect, other wry-respect adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate their words.] But the heart speakes, as it meanes, worth twenty mouthes, if it could speake audibly.</p>

<pb n="323" facs="tcp:173124:179"/> to say with tongue, <hi>there is no God:</hi> [Yea as the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in some of them, to jest at God, to blare out the tongue, and to make mouthes at God.] This foole is not so franticke; he saith, <hi>God is not,</hi> but how saith he it? his speech is not <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

            </p>
            <p>All Atheists are not of one brow; so brazd, as not to blush to deny God with mouth. <hi>Secretum meum mihi,</hi> thought is free. He saith <hi>there is no God.</hi> but it is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, it is his <hi>heart</hi> that speakes. <hi>Non est vox, neque auditio,</hi> as <hi>Gehezi</hi> said of the <hi>Shunammites</hi> dead sonne, there is no voice, that you may heare; the speech is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

But Conscience in Atheists lightly is no blabbe; they dare com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any counsell unto it. Christ saith, the mouth speakes out of the hearts abundance; and so it doth, especially the fooles; for <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, his <hi>heart is in his mouth.</hi> But when the speech is dangerous, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitally dangerous; the foole is too wise, to speake to spoile himselfe. There is gall in his heart; but he will see it shall not overflow. He will keepe the bag of it close <hi>in pericardio,</hi> that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> shall not say, that <hi>his mouth is full of bitternesse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No man makes nice of uttering safe conceipts. Nay, if it be <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bum bonum,</hi> the heart will <hi>eructare,</hi> a homely terme, but <hi>Davids, eructat cor meum verbum bonum,</hi> it will straine good manners to vent good matters. But to say, <hi>there is no God,</hi> is so odious, so dangerous, that the very <hi>fatuus,</hi> that hath his name <hi>a fando,</hi> will not <hi>mutire,</hi> not speake it never so softly. He is a foole, but yet wise in this; he can <hi>stultitiam si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulare loco,</hi> refraine his folly in some cases. <hi>In the hand of the tongue is life and death,</hi> saith <hi>Solomon;</hi> and hee will not put his life into his tongues hands. The tongue indeed it hath a double hedge, as <hi>Homer</hi> termes it, the lips, and teeth. But the heart hath a wall, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet termeth it: and one wall is surer, then two hedges. He will keepe his counsell within that. The mouth is but <hi>Atrium,</hi> the heart is <hi>Adytum,</hi> the heart is <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum,</hi> whether the Priest onely came. Nay the Priest himselfe shall not come there. Shrift is for sinnes of act, not of thought. He may thinke safely, what he will; the heart is hid from all men: God onely sees it; but there is no God. He will say it in the language of the heart, which no man understands: he will write it in the tables of his heart, which no man ever read. Doth <hi>Solomon</hi> call him <hi>foole,</hi> that trusteth to his <hi>heart?</hi> Kings may call men at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; he were a foole indeed, should he trust his secret any further. Let him with all his wisdome tell, whom hee may trust better. Will he bid him trust the Lord? for so he doth: that is <hi>petitio principii,</hi> he denies, that there is any. The heart is Sathans Cellar, where he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but a forrainer, (for he forfeited his freedome at his fall) worketh closely out of sight. There is the devils forge, where he hammers all
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:173124:180"/> impiety; like the <hi>Iesuites</hi> in the vault, the prince of darkenesse, as in a denne, or dungeon, there plots all irreligion. The heart is Sathans harlot, all heresies his bastards he begets of her. The Sire is so shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse; for being blacke he cannot blush, that he avoucheth them. But Atheisme is so ugly, so monstrous, so hideous, that the damme dares not let it come abroad.</p>
            <p>Hath <hi>the foole said in his heart.</hi> Fooles have no hearts: are they not called <hi>excordes? Solomon</hi> calls his <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>voyd of heart.</hi> But by heart is meant in Scripture, understanding and discretion: fooles have not that, but they have hearts. Yea this foole, that <hi>David</hi> meanes hath two hearts for a need, one more then ever wise man had, <hi>Psalme</hi> 12. 2. he hath <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a heart, and a heart: Many fooles double chested, stronger then the wise; this foole double hearted, more subtile then the wise.</p>
            <p>To end this second point, there are two sorts of Atheisme, <hi>mentall,</hi> and <hi>vocall.</hi> The first will haply seeme to be the lesse, because a sinne in thought, is lighter then in word: it is lesse offensive; and the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainder too is lesse; for the heart alone is guilty, the tongue hath no hand in it. And so it is indeed, if the thought determind it; I meane, if the Atheisme exp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d within the brest, if it dyed in the birth. For though a Father saith, that <hi>prava cogitatio,</hi> is <hi>Sathanae seminatio,</hi> even evill thoughts, they are the devils seeds: yet Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> hath said sweetly, <hi>peccatum, quod non placet, non nocet,</hi> the sinne hurts not, that delights not. But this Atheisme is not so. The foole here in my Text, though his speaking be but thinking, and his soule so circumspect, that he say with <hi>David, dixi, custodiam os meum, I said I will take heed unto my tongue;</hi> yet what his lippe conceales, his life reveiles. His Atheisme, though said but in secret in his heart, though his tongue betray it not, yet his Actions doe bewray it.</p>
            <p>Much rather will I pardon the mouth-atheist, then him. For he that shall openly say, There is no God, will <hi>ipso facto,</hi> be thought beside himselfe. Or if he seeme to have his wits, yet they that heare him, will all abhorre him; they will stoppe their eares against his blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, they will hisse at him, they will spit at him: his impious asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on shall not stumble any man. But the heart-Atheist, that saith God is, but thinkes it not, and lives accordingly, ungodlily, unrighteously, unsoberly; first his sinne is greater for his hypocrisie: for <hi>Simulata Sanctitas</hi> is <hi>duplex iniquitas.</hi> [Holynesse dissembled is wickednesse re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled: his mouth indeed spake holily, but hollowly, it was not from the heart.] Secondly, for offence; for all his actions are as stones before mens feet, to trippe, and to stumble at. His hearts Creed, they see not that; but his mouthes confession they heare that; and that makes them confident to follow his precedent. The man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses God, and therefore would not doe such and such things, if they were unlawfull. And if he may doe them, why may not we? Speake out false Atheist, if thou thinkst there is no God. Thou shalt be lesse guilty, and thou shalt doe lesse hurt.</p>
            <p>The foole hath shot; now let us see his bolt. Children and fooles <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
               <pb n="325" facs="tcp:173124:180"/> delight to shoote right up. So doth this foole; hee shootes his bolt, bolt up to Heaven. Whom to hit there? not Saints, not Angels. His aime is at the fairest, his Arrow is Atheisme, and his marke is God. The <hi>Sadduces</hi> yet were more religious; they denyed Angels, and all sorts of spirits, but acknowledged God. The <hi>Iewes</hi> confesse him, and so doe the <hi>Mahometans.</hi> Yea all the heathen, though they knew not who he was, yet acknowledged, that he was. In the Altar at <hi>Athens,</hi> he was cald <hi>the unknowne God;</hi> and <hi>Dion</hi> saith in <hi>Pompei,</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever that God be. [It is no mervaile, that they knew him not: for Saint <hi>Hilary</hi> saith truely, <hi>Deum nisi per Deum non intelligi,</hi> there is no knowledge of God, but by God.] But this foole, borne in the Church; the house of God, a professour of the Gospell, the Word of God; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Sonday at his Service, every <hi>Easter</hi> at his Sacrament, that hee should, not doubt, whether there be a God, but deny flatly, that there is a God, this is a mervaile. Man hath by nature a notion of God. And though Scriptures were not, the creatures would preach God. <hi>Est Coelum, &amp; tellus; Superos quid quaerimus ultrà?</hi> a heathen could say so.

Heare you not the hissing of the old Serpent? God saith, he is; the foole saith, he is not. <hi>Diabolicall</hi> impudence, to oppose to God. So did the devill; when God said to <hi>Adam, thou shalt dye;</hi> he said to <hi>Eve, you shall not dye.</hi> The foole here like his father, dares con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict God. And yet least we wrong him; let us waigh his words well. He saith, there is no <hi>Elohim.</hi> That word is indeed one of Gods names; but it is lent sometimes to Angels and to Men, to Iudges, and to all Magistrates. Waigh withall who speakes the words. It is <hi>the foole;</hi> but not the simple Innocent, but the subtile sinner. The sinner, that he may the more freely follow sinne, without checke of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and without feare of hell, footheth up his soule with this secure conceipt, there is no God. Not that his meaning is peremptorily, that God is not; but (as the <hi>Rabbins</hi> write upon this Text) <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> Gods name here meanes a Iudge. He grants God is, but not a Iudge: just like <hi>Epicurus,</hi> to have <hi>nihil negotii, nec sui, nec alieni:</hi> the blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his state, he will not disturbe, with the actions of men; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them not, he regards them not. They say it plainely in the <hi>Psal. Tush the Lord seeth not, and God regardeth not ungodlinesse and wrong.</hi> He may confesse God is, and yet deny him Iudge. The <hi>Sadducees</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge God; and yet their <hi>Proverbe</hi> in the <hi>Talmud</hi> is, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> there is no judgement, nor there is no Iudge. That being true, the foole is in his Paradise, and may feed freely. This is not my conceit, the Iewes, better judges of Hebrew words, then we, expound it so; and
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:173124:181"/> diverse Fathers second the sense too.</p>
            <p>Gods taste, saith Saint <hi>Bernard,</hi> is according to mans relish. The wise man, that doth <hi>sapere,</hi> that hath a perfect taste, he both loves God, and feares him. God to his relish, as he loves him, he tastes gratious, as he feares him, he tastes Iust. But this <hi>Insipiens,</hi> that hath no taste, not in his heart, howsoever in his palate, neither <hi>amorem,</hi> nor <hi>timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem,</hi> cannot relish God, neither his mercy, nor his justice, the two vertues of a judge; and therefore he saith flatly there is no Iudge.</p>
            <p>Surely the observing of the Crosses of the godly, as the thriving of the wicked, sollicites the ignorant, as it did the Poet, <hi>nullos esse put are deos,</hi> to thinke there is no God. But this <hi>Nabal</hi> is no idiot; he hath wit at will; tis grace he wants. His intellectuals will not let him say, there is no God. But hee observing too, both in others, that <hi>Malis bene est, bonis male,</hi> that the wicked prosper, and the godly starve; and in himselfe, that working all wickednesse, with all greedinesse, yet not the least Crosse ever lights on him, he will say, there is no Iudge. Thus prophane fooles abuse divine patience to contempt of God. Gods sweet long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufferance, whiles God doth <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, beare with mens leud manners, expecting still repentance, is turnd to the prejudice of his owne justice. The <hi>Saeducees paradoxe</hi> is this fooles <hi>paralogisme,</hi>

               </gap>, he sees, there is no judgement, and he saith, there is no Iudge.</p>
            <p>To confute this impious Atheisme, time will not let, nor shall I need: my Text hath done it for me. The two first points confute this third abundantly. First, <hi>David</hi> dubbes him <hi>foole:</hi> that very title discredits his divinity. Secondly, his saying of it onely in his heart, showes plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his conceit is not avouchable. Else he would speake it out. So that this foole, that saith there is no Iudge, hath found two Iudges here; the one is the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> the other is himselfe. He is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, his owne Iudge, and Condemner. This is the Foole, with the two hearts, we spake of. The one heart knowes, that the other heart lies, as Saint <hi>Hil.</hi> saith of those that were seduc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t by the <hi>Arians, Credunt, quod non cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dunt,</hi> the one heart beleeves, that the other beleeves not. That knows there is a Iudge, though this say, there is none. And therefore the foole speakes frowardly, but inwardly; he dares not voice it, but saith it to himselfe.</p>
            <p>To Conclude; this glosse of the <hi>Rabbines,</hi> to conster Iudge for God, is haply more nice, then needs. Tis in effect all one, to say, God is not; as to say, he is not Iudge. If God be God, he must be Iust. For all Gods attributes are all God selfe. His truth, his mercy, his wisdome, and what else, they all are God. Iustice is one of them. He that denies it, denies his deity. And therefore tis all one to say, there is no Iudge, and to say, there is no God. And therefore I will fairely returne my Text to the usuall Translation, that the <hi>foole saith in his heart, there is no God.</hi> To that God, whom he denies, but we confesse, searcher of all hearts, and Iudge of all men, let us duly give, <hi>maugre</hi> all Fooles, all honour, &amp;c.</p>

No fashion ever followed so generally, as this. To hide it, not haply by flat denying it, as <hi>Cain</hi> did; but by transferring the blame of it upon some other. The sinne is mine, <hi>peccatum meum,</hi> but not meerely. I did the Act; but He, or Shee, incited me. I cannot hide the sinne, but I will slide the blame upon some other. <hi>Adams</hi> Art too. When God examined him, why he ate the Apple, hee said, The woman tempted him. When he examined <hi>Eve,</hi> shee said the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent tempted her. Am I found <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, deprehended in the Act, taken with the manner? I must say, I have sinned, and I must say, Tis my sinne. But the (I,) and the (My) will appeach an Accessory; with their wills, a Principall, but an Accessory at least. The sinne is <hi>meum,</hi> tis my sinne; but the My, but a <hi>Demie,</hi> but a moitie of the sinne is mine; a halfe is His, or Hers, tis a third persons. When <hi>Moses</hi> expostulated with <hi>Aaron</hi> for the molten Calfe, hee put the fault upon the people; they bad him make it, and they brought him the materialls. <hi>Saul</hi> char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by <hi>Samuel</hi> with disobedience, in sparing the King and cattell of the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> excused him also by the people, they brought, and they spared; and all in the third person. <hi>David</hi> doth not so; hee takes
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:173124:182"/> the sinne singlely and solely to himselfe, <hi>My sinne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My sinne is ever in my sight. Our eyes are like the old womans in the Comedie, <hi>Oculi emissitti,</hi> rowling eyes, spying and prying into others actions: pur-blind, stone-blind at home, sharpe-eyed abroad, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, flatterers of our selves. <hi>Cain</hi> said he was not his brothers keeper, but belike we are, our bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers keepers, wee should be in the right sense, but we are in a wrong, our brothers keepers, severe observers of our neighbours sinne. They are adulterers, unjust, extortioners. Even <hi>David</hi> could say (but it was done in his passion) <hi>Omnis homo mendax, all men are lyars.</hi> My brothers sinne is soone before me. But what have I to doe to judge anothers servant? He stands, or falls to his owne master. I am my brothers keeper, not my brothers judge. A just man (saith <hi>Solomon</hi>) should be <hi>Accusator sui,</hi> an appeacher of himselfe; and <hi>Solomons</hi> Father here cries, <hi>peccatum meum, my</hi> sinne is before me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My sinne, &amp;c.</hi> We call all things ours, many things that are not so, that are not truly so. But sinne is truly ours, ours properly. That which is <hi>aliunde,</hi> is not truely mine: that which is of my selfe, thats mine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and so is sinne. All good things are from God, <hi>Tua bona Dei dona, August.</hi> Man may terme all things his, his to use. But the first, <hi>Doner,</hi> is the right Owner, they are Gods indeed. But sinne is mans. God hath no part in it, can lay no claime to it; tis meerely mans. All things which we call ours; they are so ours, that wee owe both their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and encrease to God. But sinne simply ours, both birth and growth of it is from our selves. Say not, tis from the world; tis from our flesh. I will not charge the devill with my sinne.

               </gap>, persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive onely, not compulsive. Mine owne lust leads me to sinne. The lust is mine, and therefore the sinne is mine. Heaven and earth are Gods; the one is his Footestoole, the other is his Throne. The sea is his, the <hi>Psalme</hi> saith too. All in them all is his, <hi>&amp; plenitudo ejus,</hi> saith the <hi>Psalmist;</hi> whatsoever is in them, is the Lords. But sinne is not, thats none of Gods. Sinne hath no owner, but the devill and man onely. God cannot say, <hi>my</hi> sinne. All men may, saving he, who was both man and God.</p>
            <p>To end this; <hi>My sinne?</hi> What sinne? <hi>Davids</hi> sinne was not ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary. Ordinary sinnes are soone forgot; they are not ever, they are scarce at all before us. <hi>David</hi> had fallen grievously, bereaved <hi>Vrias</hi> both of wife and life. Such a sinne would not suffer his conscience to have peace; but like a thorne in ones side, so would it in his soule be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver galling and wounding him. <hi>Peters</hi> sinne, and <hi>Pauls</hi> were hainous both; the one denied Christ, the other persecuted him. But <hi>Peter</hi> did it in his feare, <hi>Paul</hi> did it in his zeale. And infirmitie and ignorance obtaining mercie more easily with God, the conscience is the sooner stilled. But <hi>Davids</hi> sinne not great onely, (theirs was so) but malicious too, a double sinne, two of the greatest commandements of the second Table broken at one clappe, his heart must still upbraid him, <hi>Injuriae ut furiae Cic.</hi> This sinne like a furie, like a Feend ever before him. The wise man bids bind not two sinnes together. <hi>David</hi> did, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

<pb n="330" facs="tcp:173124:183"/> speakes in the <hi>Psalmes,</hi> iniquitie upon iniquitie, two crying sinnes, <hi>peccatum cum voce,</hi> as <hi>Gregory</hi> calls it; the first too bad, but the second worse, <hi>posterius, deterius,</hi> murther added to adultery. Adultery a great sinne, one man to climbe an others bed; murther a greater, one man to spill anothers bloud. Adultery a greater sinne, (<hi>Thales</hi> said) than per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, nay <hi>Chrysostome</hi> saith, than Idolatrie. But murther a bloudy sinne, a scarlet sin. Well might he say, his sinne was great, <hi>Psa. 25. nec modicum nic unicum,</hi> neither little, nor one onely. Hee playes the King in his sinne, he goes a progresse in it, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

            <p>[No sinne (saith <hi>Seneca) Manet intra se,</hi> no sinne lightly keepes within it selfe▪ but windes, and enwreathes it selfe within an other, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaines it selfe within another, one drawes another. <hi>Davids</hi> did so. Lust drew Murther. In sinnes chaine, as lust is next linke to drunkennesse, or sloth, so bloudshed often is next linke to it.]</p>
            <p>Murther and Adultery reckoned by Schoolemen, both deadly sinnes. What say I both? As if there were but two? There are indeed but two maine sinnes onely; but they have many concomitants. Slouth and lust their dammes. <hi>David</hi> sleepes in the day time. <hi>Nestor</hi> saith in <hi>Homer,</hi>

               </gap>, Kings should not sleepe all night. <hi>David</hi> sleepes in the day; and that in time of warre, when men should be most wakefull. Dissimulation; he pretends kindnesse to <hi>Vrias,</hi> he sends a present after him. Treacherie, wicked treacherie; he sets him in the front of the battell, and causes his fellows to recoile, and so betraies him to the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie. Yea and (<hi>Bellerophon</hi> like) hee makes him bearer of the letters writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to that purpose. What should I speake of his making of him drunke? Thats no sinne now adayes. <hi>Ludus stulto facere scelus, Solomon</hi> saith, Fooles; but wise men now adayes make a sport of that wickednesse, one to make another drunke. Nay, and (which may not be omitted) he betraies a multitude of his people to the sword at the same time with him. Tis not <hi>Vrias</hi> bloud alone, but the bloud of many, that <hi>David</hi> sheds at once. Lastly (to pretermit sundry other sinnes) his sencelesse securitie, and long impenitencie. He lay tenne moneths at least with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sense of his sinne, it is plaine by the storie. What a sort of sinnes here waite on one? This is the sinne, which <hi>David</hi> here calls his sinne, <hi>My sinne, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next terme is the Object, My <hi>sinne</hi> is ever before me. In the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> I was long, I will be short in this. <hi>My sinne.</hi> Men will bragge of their well-doings; they are ever in their minde, ever in their mouth. The Pharisee will say, he is a sober man, an honest man, a just man; hee fasts, and he paies tithes. Nay his mouth will not serve, he will hire a Trumpettour, to sound in the streetes, to assemble the people to the sight of his almes. Hee will have his largesse be not before himselfe alone, but before others also. <hi>Obadiah</hi> will bring his pietie before <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias; Hast thou not heard, how I hid an hundred Prophets.</hi> The good things which we either have or doe, they ever are before us. If God have given us any thing above our brethren, we vant of that. The rich man in the Gospell of his wealth, <hi>Soule, thou hast much goods.</hi> The proud King in the Prophet, of his building, <hi>Is not this the great Babell,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:173124:183"/> which I have built, &amp;c.</hi> thats for the one, good fortunes: and for grace, <hi>come see my zeale,</hi> saith <hi>Iehu</hi> to <hi>Iehonadab.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though the wise mans lesson be, let another mans mouth commend thee, not thine owne; yet the tongue travels with her masters phrase, and hath no ease til it deliver it. The Hen will not lay an Egge, but shee will cackle. Praise should bee pronound with the third person, with hee and his. But the first, which before was backward and unwilling, is forward enough here: yea and that even in the number singular. Both in the primitive, you heard <hi>Ahabs</hi> Steward, <hi>ego pavi, I</hi> hid, and <hi>I</hi> fed an hundred prophets, and in the possessive you heard <hi>Iehu</hi> too, come see <hi>my</hi> zeale. So well content to vent the owne vertues, that it will owne sometimes some actions done by others. Praise doth <hi>Sordescere,</hi> the proverbe saith in mans owne mouth. Modesty blusheth, not to challeng onely, but to acknowledge even her right. The Iewes medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating to Christ for the <hi>Centurion,</hi> said, <hi>dignus est;</hi> but himselfe would say, <hi>Indignus sum, Lord I am not worthy.</hi> Let them tell if they would, himselfe would not, <hi>that he loved their nation, and had built them a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue.</hi> Christ sayd, <hi>Iohn</hi> was <hi>Elias;</hi> himselfe sayd, <hi>I am not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My <hi>sinne, &amp;c.</hi> Not good things onely, but some evill too, <hi>malum poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae,</hi> are ever before us, ready to complaine of the least crosse, and to put <hi>Meum</hi> before it. I sayd, <hi>Cain</hi> cryed, my sinne, or mine iniquity, because the word properly sounds so in the originall. But some tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slate it, and perhaps he meant it so, and the context beares it better, my <hi>paine,</hi> or my <hi>punishment,</hi> that hee confessed not his sinne, but mutind at Gods sentence. Any <hi>good</hi> thing, any <hi>evill</hi> thing, so it be not <hi>malum culpae,</hi> endures this person, (I) and (mine) endures it? nay affects it. I should say rather, the person affects them; my <hi>fruites,</hi> my <hi>barnes,</hi> saith the rich man in Christs parable. My <hi>might,</hi> my <hi>majestie,</hi> saith the King of <hi>Babel,</hi> my <hi>zeale,</hi> saith <hi>Iehu,</hi> my <hi>punishment,</hi> saith <hi>Cain.</hi> But <hi>Peccatum</hi> is a Beare, <hi>Meum</hi> is affraid of it. Or rather tis a stake, and <hi>Meum</hi> like a Beare is loath to be drawne to it, and so much in breefe onely of the second terme.</p>
            <p>The third is next. In it Translatours differ. Some turne the terme <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
               <hi>before me,</hi> some <hi>against me.</hi> Tis true too, that sinne is against him, that committeth it. Sinne is the greatest enemy man hath. But the context leanes not to that sense. Tis therefore translated by <hi>Tremellius,</hi> not <hi>Adversatur,</hi> but <hi>Obversatur mihi,</hi> it is ever in my sight. And this sense too hath two constructions; some thinking <hi>David</hi> meant it of confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; because the first part of the verse sounded to that sense. And it is usuall in the <hi>Proverbes</hi> and the <hi>Psalmes</hi> to second the same sense, as the <hi>Rabbins</hi> speake, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in different phrase. I rather follow those, they are the most and best, who rather thinke it the controll of <hi>Davids</hi> conscience, continually rubbing him with the remembrance of his sinne. My sinne is <hi>before</hi> mee. Sinne flies mans eyes, is loath to come before him. Or rather man flies sinne, flies the face of it. Tis <hi>Comes individuus:</hi> having once admitted it, once committed it, he can not flie it, it clings close to him. All hee can doe, is to turne his back on it, to say to sinne as Christ sayd unto Sathan, <hi>Vade post me,</hi> sinne,
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:173124:184"/>
               <hi>get thee behind mee.</hi> That is the position which the sinner seekes both for himselfe, and for his sinne. The <hi>first</hi> man hath taught <hi>all</hi> men that. When God said to him, <hi>Adam, where art thou?</hi> was he not behind the Trees? And as the Adulterer loathes lightly to look on his base child: so sinne, the broode of Sathan, the base brat of Sathan begotten by the Devill on concupiscence, man cannot suffer in his sight, but cries, <hi>Vade post me,</hi> bids it, Avoid, and get behind him.</p>
            <p>Where is a man almost will be a knowne of sinne? will not hide it <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> saith <hi>Iob,</hi> as <hi>Adam</hi> did, close it in the closet of his heart, and keepe that closet too, as <hi>Salomon</hi> bids but to better purpose, <hi>omni cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stodia, with all dilligence;</hi> that it come not <hi>coram,</hi> that it breake not forth to affront and encounter him. The Harlot in the <hi>Proverbes</hi> lookes demurely; shee hath eaten, saith <hi>Salomon,</hi> but shee wipes her mouth, and cries, <hi>non sum operata,</hi> shee has done no evill. <hi>Saul</hi> will brag to <hi>Samuel</hi> of fulfilling Gods commandement, comming fresh from the breach of it. <hi>Cain</hi> askt where <hi>Abel</hi> was, can answer God, he knowes not; and <hi>Gehezi Elizeus, Thy servant went no whether:</hi> What cite I Harlots, <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Cain?</hi> even the plainest man, and openest, that hates all dissimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, yet will dissemble sinne. Nor is this indeede the point. <hi>Davids</hi> sinne here is before himselfe, not others; my sinne is before <hi>mee:</hi> Let <hi>Saul,</hi> let <hi>Gehezi,</hi> let the Harlot too, conceale their sinnes from others sight. There is some reason: some? great reason I should hide my sinne from others. For my sinne is my shame; shall I not be shie of it? Sinne indeede is dangerous if it come <hi>coram nobis.</hi> But why should I hide it from my selfe? why should not my sinne come like <hi>Davids, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram me?</hi> be ever before mee? Surely it may, and should. But when all things be as they should, the world will end. I show not what men should, but what they doe. Wee <hi>doe,</hi> that wee shall <hi>not,</hi> cast them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde us. Wee have a wallet, which we hang halfe before, and halfe behinde us. In the halfe before wee put our vertues, our vices in the halfe behind. That part wherein our better Actions are is still in sight. But that wherein our sinnes are, <hi>non videmus id manticae,</hi> wee have no eyes <hi>in Occipitio.</hi> Surely they are blessed, whose sinnes are covered, <hi>David</hi> saith: But whose sinnes are covered by Christ, not by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; themselves must open them. God will not heale them, that is, cure them, except we unheale them, that is, uncover them. God will not cast our sinnes behind his backe, except we bring them first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our face.</p>
            <p>There are, that are not so supine, to cast their sinnes behind them; and yet they shall not bee before them neither, not ever before them. Is there not a third position betweene both? They will lay by their sin; lay them not behind them, but beside them, lay them by for the present. Thinke of them they will, but at some other time. I have some busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; they will distract mee. I am merry with my friends; they will disturbe mee. I will say unto my conscience as <hi>Felix</hi> sayd to <hi>Paul,</hi> hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him dispute of the judgement to come, Goe thy wayes for this time when I have more leasure, then I will call for thee.</p>
            <p>Man will not, not onely <hi>not</hi> doe it himselfe, but not suffer others nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to set his sinne before him: Not Kings onely; theres some reason,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:173124:184"/> subjects should not censure Soveraignes. Wilt thou say (saith <hi>Iob</hi>) unto a King thou art wicked? But in this every subject almost will bee a King. No man so meane, that will indure another to dare censure him; no not his superiour. <hi>Abner</hi> will not be chargd with lying with <hi>Sauls</hi> Concubine, no not by <hi>Sauls</hi> sonne. <hi>Ishbosheth</hi> shall dearely buy his challeng. Every man will say unto him, that shall offer but brotherly to admonish him, that which the Hebrewes sayd to <hi>Moses,</hi> who made <hi>thee</hi> a judge? Gods Prophet may not dare to set a mans sinne before him. If <hi>Iohn</hi> shall checke <hi>Herod</hi> with his brothers wife, it will cost him his head. This office so dangerous, that no man dare adventure it, there's one yet that dares execute. God hath one hardy officer, that dares arrest the sinner, though hee be <hi>Caesars</hi> selfe. It is the conscience. It will not supparasite the stoutest sinner. But as <hi>Paul</hi> did to <hi>Peter,</hi> it will <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

Shunne it in one place, it will meete thee in another, as the Angell did <hi>Balaam.</hi> Be in the way, it will be before thee there. Turne toward the Vineyards, it will stand against thee there. Seeke yet a narrower place, it will meete thee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so there. Thou playest but <hi>Balams</hi> Asse in shifting and shunning it; shut thine eies: yet shee will speake. Stop thine eares, that will not serve, her words are stripes, shee smites <hi>surdo verbere,</hi> saith the Poet, her strokes sound not, they are within the heart. Thither shee will summon all thy sinnes, show thee the true shape of them. Even as the Samaritane woman sayd of Christ, she will tell thee all things, that thou didst in all thy life.</p>
            <p>Art thou secure, and yet hast sinned? It is because thou fearest no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutioner. Thou fearest not him, because theres none to judge thee. There's none to judge, because there's none accuser. There's none to accuse, because theres none to witnesse. There is no witnesse, because thy sin is secret. Thou foole, thou hast all these within thy selfe. Thy conscience is them all, accuser, witnesse, jurie, judge, executioner. Thou hast a Court within thy heart, the Court indeede of conscience. For conscience there acts all these offices, indites, convicts, condemnes, and executes.</p>
            <p>Conscience God put of purpose in mans heart, to bee his keeper, to watch him in his wayes, in all his wayes. See thou observe Gods law; for thy conscience observes thee. And it will not take a bribe, as some observers doe, to see, and to be silent. Looke what it sees, it saith. Set thou thy sinnes behind thee, or beside thee: <hi>it</hi> will set them all before thee. It is the soules Looking-glasse; shee shall not have a spot, but it will show it her. Commit not sinne to thy conscience to conceale. It is a bad counsell-keeper. Sinne not in her sight; thou shalt be sure to heare of it. Shee will not eliminate, tell it out of doores to others; but shee will twit thee with it, checke, and chide, and chalenge thee. Stand, sit, lye downe, turne thee which way thou wilt; still shee will bee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee, and set thy sinne full in thy sight.</p>
            <p>Sinne is a Serpent, like unto her Sire, and this is her sting, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:173124:185"/> controll and upbraiding of the conscience. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a bitter sting, <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> bitter above Wormewood, above Gall, the Gall of Aspes, of Dragons. Not the bare upbraiding, thats not all, to set the <hi>sinne</hi> before us onely; but the pressing of the paine of it, wrath, judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and damnation. This to a gracelesse man is as the gates of Hell: a horrour to the godliest. Twill make <hi>Paul</hi> cry, <hi>Infelix ego,</hi> but <hi>Cain</hi> to despaire, <hi>Iudas</hi> to hang himselfe.</p>
            <p>The pricke of this sting had pierc't to <hi>Davids</hi> heart, himselfe saith in this <hi>Psalme,</hi> it had broken even his bones. His conscience had presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted both his sinnes before him, both lust and blood. Hee saw the face, the ugly face of both; yea and the face of Gods displeasure too; the 3. verse hath them both of 38. <hi>Psalme,</hi> and there was neither rest in his bones, nor soundnesse in his flesh, <hi>à facie peccatorum,</hi> through the grisly countenance of his grievous sinnes.</p>
            <p>I must omit here many things▪ which I purposd in this point. To end it, the conscience is the Character both of Gods grace and justice. Hee hath given it unto man, both to admonish him, lest he sinne, and to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish him if he sinne. And tis haply that <hi>Genius,</hi> which Heathens imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned every man to have, a good Angell, and a bad: the one to advise him unto vertue, the other to chasten him for vice. For the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence acts both offices. Tis both <hi>Fraenum &amp; Flagrum,</hi> both a bit and a whip; a bit before the sinne, <hi>quomodo hoc faciam?</hi> saith <hi>Ioseph</hi> to his mistresse, how may I doe this thing? and a whip after it, <hi>Ier. 8. Quid feci?</hi> What have I done? A curbe before the sinne, Oh doe not so wickedly, as <hi>Thamar</hi> sayd to <hi>Amnon;</hi> and a scourge after it, Did not I tell you? sayd <hi>Reuben</hi> to his brethren. Heare it, when it checkes thee like a bit; and thou shalt not feele it chasten thee like a whippe. Kick not against it, tis a pricke. Surely, if thou wilt not let it bridle thee, it will saddle thee. If thy mouth refuse the bit; thy backe will beare a burden that will breake it, without grace; yea and thy belly too; bee <hi>Iudas</hi> an example; hee burst asunder, and his bowells gushed out. <hi>Salomon</hi> saith, wine is; surely sinne is, <hi>tumultuator,</hi> a turbulent raiser of tumults in the soule. The soule of a sinner is like a raging sea; the Prophet saith. Sinne, like mud, and mire, the waves cast up before it <hi>continually,</hi> and that is the last point of my Text; <hi>my sinne,</hi> saith the <hi>Psalmist, is ever before me.</hi> That, and some moe omissions, which time permits not now, I may happily adde hereafter.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is not long since I entreated of this Text. Time forc't me then to omit many things, and to leave the last Terme quite untoucht. My mind now is not to reiterate any thing delivered then. One Scripture may be glossed diversly. My project is the same; that I may not alter, the continuall controll of a guiltie conscience; but set downe by the <hi>Psalmist in hypothesi,</hi> in his owne particular and personall experience.</p>
            <p>The Text containes foure Termes; an Object, <hi>Sinne;</hi> the Subject, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
               <hi>David; My sinne.</hi> The Act, it Affronts him, it is <hi>before me,</hi> saith the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>

            </p>
            <p>For the first; Could <hi>David</hi> sinne, a King? Kings cannot sinne: are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> they not Gods? They are so; but by Nuncupation; by Participation, saith Saint <hi>Augustine.</hi> Angels are Gods so; and yet have sinned. But sinne is Law-breach; <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> definition, <hi>Sinne the transgression of the Law.</hi> How should Kings sinne? They are above the Law; above mans Law, not Gods. It seemes above Gods too. For when <hi>Ahab</hi> made conscience of <hi>Naboths</hi> Vineyard; What? saith his wife to him, <hi>Art thou a King? Vtinam liceret! Nero</hi> in his lust cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:173124:186"/> Oh that it were lawfull; his mother answered him, <hi>Si libet, licet;</hi> if he pleasd he might. The Lists of lawes bind not the lusts of Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours; no not of Gods Law. <hi>Licere, an Placere, quis in Rege?</hi> If a Kings lust lie to any thing; nere aske the question, if it be lawfull. So Flatterers are wont to pander Princes, to supparasite Kings. But yet if Kings did sinne, they might be censur'd. Kings are uncontroleable. Who <hi>will say</hi> (saith <hi>Iob) to a King, thou art wicked?</hi> That shewes that tis not safe at all to censure them; or, if you will, not lawfull in a compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sory way, but in a consultory, if with due respect or discretion. Prophets have done it so. <hi>Samuel</hi> did, <hi>Elias</hi> and <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> did. What neede I seeke for instance further than this <hi>Psalme?</hi> The title tells us <hi>Nathan</hi> did. [Kings all are sinners, one excepted, the King of Kings. Why have Kings Confessors, if they could not sinne? Popes (I trow) Kings superiours, yet can sinne. Their Parasites say, they cannot erre; they denie not, they can sinne. <hi>David</hi> here, though a King, yet saith, <hi>My sinne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>My sinne,</hi> Saints have their sinnes; thats more than Kings. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarkes, the Prophets, the Apostles had their sinnes. Never any sonne of man, saving the Sonne of man, was quit of sinne. One daughter is excepted, but never any sonne. <hi>Novatus</hi> first, and <hi>Pelagius</hi> after him, held that schismaticall heresie, that a man may live without all sinne. Would you beleeve that Papists hold it too? The Councill of <hi>Trent</hi> doth; <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth. Nay <hi>Bellarmine</hi> saith, all Catholikes, that is, all Papists doe; without all <hi>mortall</hi> sinne; but not without all <hi>veniall;</hi> they dare not venture that. And yet one doth; <hi>Bonaventure</hi> dares ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture that, A man may leade his whole life without all sinne. What should we heed, what <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, <hi>Non est homo, qui non peccet, there is no man, that sinnes not?</hi> The Papists, some of them said; that a man once justified may ever after live without any kind of sinne. These are the right Puritans.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My sinne,</hi> saith <hi>David. Davids</hi> sinne, but which? Or sinned he but once onely? The Scripture seemes to say so: <hi>That he walked in all the wayes of the Lord, all the dayes of his life, save onely in the matter of Vrias:</hi> But thats but an <hi>Hyperbole.</hi> No doubt but <hi>Davids</hi> sinnes were many. Proofe needs not; he confesseth it: his sinnes were more <hi>than the haires of his head.</hi> But he meanes here his Adulterie with <hi>Bathshabe,</hi> and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Vrias.</hi> Said I before, Saints had their sinnes? Such sinnes are ill beseeming Saints. What shall the sonne of <hi>Beliall</hi> doe, if Saints doe this? What is the Libertines sinne, the Philistins sinne, if this be <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids?</hi> Saints sinne not onely; but their sinnes sometimes are (as <hi>Paul</hi> phraseth it) out of measure sinfull. <hi>Noahs</hi> drunkennesse, <hi>Lots</hi> incest, <hi>Iudahs</hi> fornication, hainous sinnes all; <hi>Davids</hi> lust linkt with bloud ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds them all. Gods Spirit not assisting with Grace, the godliest man may act the deadliest sinne. <hi>Peter,</hi> a Pillar, as <hi>Paul</hi> calls him, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>OEcum.</hi> a pillar of faith, yet denied Christ. <hi>Solomon, Iedidiah, i. Gods beloved,</hi> worshipt strange gods. <hi>David</hi> a man according to Gods heart, a Leacher, and a Murtherer.</p>
            <p>Now put together these two severalls, a Kings sinne, and a Saints, and see how great a sinne they spell. The sinne is great <hi>per se,</hi> Spouse
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:173124:186"/> breach, and bloud shead both great sinnes <hi>per se,</hi> whose sinnes soever. But to be His sinnes, <hi>Davids</hi> sinnes, Gods anointeds sinnes, anointed both with oyle by his Prophet, and with Grace by his Spirit; both <hi>Vnctus Dei, &amp; Sanctus Dei,</hi> Gods King, and his holy one, surely that makes the sinne farre more transcendent. A Kings sinne, a great scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall. <hi>Regis ad exemplum,</hi> saith the Poet, Princes acts are all precedents. What will Subjects care to sinne, when they see their <hi>Caesars</hi> sample? <hi>Tutum est peccare authoribus illis.</hi> But a Saints sinne is farre mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous: Not a stone onely of offence for the weake to stumble at; but as <hi>Nathan</hi> told <hi>David</hi> in this very cause, an occasion to the wicked to blaspheme God. This sinne, such a sinne of such a sinners, it is no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell, if the Actor say, it is ever before him: <hi>My sinne</hi> (saith <hi>David) is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver before me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>David</hi> doth not <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> follow mans fashion, as <hi>Iob</hi> speakes, to hide <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> his sinne; but confesseth it. Nor doth he hood it neither, mans fashion too, by some <hi>Terminus diminuens,</hi> to lessen it at least. If sinne must needs be seene, needs come before us; she will come as cleanely habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as she can. Her Blackeamore skinne she can not change; but shee will shroud it with a little lawne. Her face, if shee may, shall have a maske, to cover it; if not, yet a wimple at least, to shadow it. Am I deprehended, or detected, that I needs must crie <hi>Peccavi?</hi> Will my conscience, as Gods Commissarie, force me to confesse? I will pray that yet the forme may be with favour; that my shame may be sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with either the civilitie, or the generalitie of the Terme. Should I say my drunkennesse? Let it be my Intemperancie. Should I say my whoredome? Let it be my Incontinencie. Should it be my wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse? Let it be my <hi>sinne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, I may not say <hi>my sinne;</hi> that Terme is too broad. <hi>David</hi> did; I will not. For I see in the Gospell what base esteeme was made of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. I will seeke some milder word. <hi>Erravi, temere feci,</hi> I have done amisse or unadvisedly. I know Saint <hi>Austin</hi> saith, that sinne is nothing. But he shall pardon me: haply hath some other meaning. It is an odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and an hainous Terme. <hi>David</hi> said once, <hi>it was his infirmitie.</hi> I will say so too. There are <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, negligences, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, defaults, mistakings, trippes and slippes. I will acknowledge any one of these, and call it <hi>mine.</hi> But I will not say my <hi>sinne.</hi> I will use his terme, that turned this <hi>Psalme</hi> into Meeter, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. my <hi>blot,</hi> or my <hi>spot.</hi> But as <hi>Luther</hi> said of the word <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that his soule hated it; so my heart hateth this word (<hi>Sinne,</hi>) my tongue can not pronounce it, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nound with this Person, I cannot say, <hi>my sinne.</hi> If a man must smite him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe; it shall be softly; if censure his owne sinne; it shall be gently. What mouth wil not lie lightly, but at least wil not tell a faire tale for his master? Every tongue will extenuate his masters trespasse. If a beame be in his eye; tis but a moate; if an <hi>Elephant</hi> in his throat; tis but a gnat.</p>
            <p>The sinne here meant by <hi>David,</hi> though Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> say of it, <hi>Noluit sileri quod voluit scribi,</hi> what Scripture hath recorded, God would not have concealed: yet loath I am to aggravate such a persons sinne, a Saints, a Prophets, a Patriarkes sinne. And I toucht that point in part the last time. Let <hi>Davids</hi> selfe censure it, <hi>Psal.</hi> 19. he calls it
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:173124:187"/> there the great offence. Yet such offenses sinners extenuate. Murther and Whoredome, the greatest sinnes, the second Table hath; yet wit hath words to qualifie, to allay the odiousnesse even of them toe. No sinne so rightly called <hi>Peccatum,</hi> as Adultery. For Civilians say, <hi>Pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> is <hi>quasi Pellicatum,</hi> sinne properly is harlottrie. That had <hi>David</hi> beene a Catholicke, and had prayed here in <hi>Latin,</hi> he could not more perspicuouslly have specified his sinne. Yet the Harlots wickednesse will be but termed a scape. <hi>David</hi> meaning haply this sinne by that phrase in the 25. <hi>Psalme, delicta juventutis meae,</hi> the escapes of his youth; for he was of no great age, when he fell into such sinne; prophanenesse haply hath fetch the phrase from thence, to terme whoredome but a tricke of youth. Tis but <hi>Delictum</hi> not <hi>Peccatum,</hi> an escape, but not a sinne. The devills figure of diminution. Though I shall slay a man: I will confesse my choler; but I will not say, my sinne.</p>
            <p>Secondly say, conscience tie me to <hi>Davids</hi> terme, force me to say, <hi>my sinne:</hi> yet will I doe it in diminutives. As <hi>Lot</hi> said of <hi>Zoar,</hi> so I will of my sinne, <hi>an non modica est? Is it not a little one?</hi> I will thinne my my sinne, in the <hi>Adjective</hi> at least, if I can not in the <hi>Substantive.</hi> Tis in my minde remarkeable, that of all words, sinne hath no Diminutive, not in any tongue, known to us commonly. Onely the <hi>Spaniard</hi> hath his <hi>Peccadillo, i.</hi> a petie sinne. <hi>Caesar</hi> was told, <hi>Hominibus, non verbis,</hi> hee might endenise men, but not words. But some Catholike mint is above <hi>Caesars,</hi> they can coine words too.</p>
            <p>To end this, there is a quaint Divinitie among the Libertines, that sinne is but a meere conceit; that right repentance is deniall of sinne. That <hi>Peter</hi> was pardoned, because hee beleeved, he had not sinned in denying Christ; <hi>Iudas</hi> not pardoned, because he confest, he had sinned in betraying him. To presse them, bootes not with the Scriptures; they goe not by the Word, but by the Spirit, But what a foole is Sathan, that he can not plead not guiltie, and so come out of hell!</p>
            <p>Now come wee to the conscience checking and controlling <hi>David</hi> for his sinne. For that is the sense of the subsequent phrase, that his sinne is <hi>before him.</hi> His conscience presents the image of his sinne ever to his sight, charging him with it, and chastening him for it. That Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject I prosecuted at large the last time; but was forc't to breake it off abruptly. Any thing than uttered I will not now reiterate. I meane this Sermon but a supplement to that. Sinne, like the booke in the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,</hi> which Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> was bid to eat, <hi>It was sweet in the mouth, but bitter in the bellie:</hi> So it goes glibly downe, as smooth as oyle. But the conscience, which is the stomacke of the soule, disdaines and loathes it; and faine would cast it up againe; but that <hi>factum</hi> can not be <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectum,</hi> yet it yeoxeth and exhales many loathsome savours; it upbraids the sinner. <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, <hi>Wine is;</hi> surely sinne is <hi>Tumultuator,</hi> a muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, a stirrer of turbulent risings and tumults in the soule. But of the (<hi>Pro</hi>) I spake last time sufficiently; now onely of the (<hi>Contra.</hi>)</p>
            <p>There is a conscience keepes all close, never checkes, never upbraids the sinner, never once troubles him. He may doe what he will. Hee is (as <hi>Paul</hi> termes it, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 19. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, benum'd in his conscience,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:173124:187"/> stupified, and senselesse. Doe he never so much, never so great wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, he hath no remorse of it, no <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, no spirit of compun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. His worme is dead, or charm'd; it bites not, it gnawes not. A cauterized conscience, <hi>Pauls</hi> terme too, seard with the Devills iron, and utterly without feeling. Or say the conscience doe her duty; yet <hi>Paul</hi> notes some that can repell, can put away the conscience, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. That if it be querilous, will stop the eare; if it bee clamorous, will cry as Christ did to the wind, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>peace and be quiet.</hi> Their sinnes either never before them at all, or before them in vaine: they sinne securely, and contemne all controll.</p>
            <p>God put in man the conscience purposely for sinne; if it might, to keepe him from it; or if not, to whip him for it. It is both <hi>fraenum &amp; fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grum.</hi> It is the soules lanterne, a Greeke Father calls it so, by it to see her sinnes. But as spirits (as some say) first make the light burne blew, and at the last to goe quite out: so the Devill with his blast will blow the Candle out; the soule shall see nought by it. It is the soules book, Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> calls it so. The records of all our actions are enrolled in it. But Sathan will be sure, either so to claspe it, that the soule shall not open it; or so to race it, that shee shall not reade in it. Mans soule and body are full of sin throughout. The conscience is the <hi>Index, Ioh.</hi> 8. 9. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the table which will teach to turne to every one. But the Devill comes &amp; rends it out. It is the soules glasse, the same Father termes it so. The soule hath not a spot, but shee may see it. But the Devill with his breath will dull and dimme it so, that the soule shall see nought in it. Though the sinner shall have wrought never so much wickednesse; yet hee will say with <hi>Paul, Nihil mihi conscius sum, I know nothing by my selfe.</hi> Of his conscience, hee is inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.</p>
            <p>Surely there is a quiet and still conscience, which is good: that hath <hi>Sensum,</hi> but not <hi>Consensum,</hi> it feeles sinne, but approves it not. The <hi>righteous</hi> man hath <hi>it.</hi> It sets his sinne before him, and no more. It im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunes him not, disturbes him not; because hee repents presently, and Gods spirits ministers comfort to his Spirit. But the quiet consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, wee meane here, has <hi>Consensum,</hi> but not <hi>Sensum;</hi> the distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is Saint <hi>Bernards:</hi> It gives assent to sinne, but has no sense of sinne. Many wicked men have it; and some righteous too sometimes. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> had it for a time. Hee lay a whole yeare lazing in his sinne, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any sense of it. A conscience crosse to her creation. Shee was made by God to withstand sinne, but to feele it, shee quite contrary feeles it not, and consents to it; conspires with concupiscence to betray the soule with silence: as a dogge should take bread of a theife, and not barke at him; so the conscience to be flattered by sinne, and not stirre at it. A desperate case, when that which should be <hi>Sacra anchora,</hi> as S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> calls the conscience, the last refuge in extremity, when that shall faile too. When witnesse and accuser and judge too (for you heard the last time, that the conscience is all three) and all shall bee corrupted. God hath appointed it to be mans keeper: when the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per shall consent to the escape of his prisoner.</p>
            <p>To this end: happy is the sinner, whose conscience rouses him, lets
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:173124:188"/> him not lie drowzing in the Lethargie of sinne; but presents it to his sight. For how shall he sorrow for the sinne, hee sees not? so that his sorrow bee not without hope. But his condition miserable, who sinnes to day, to morrow, every day, without the least controll of conscience. It sees but saith nothing. Tis seated in our soules to set our sinnes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us. Will it not: then will Gods selfe. <hi>I will,</hi> saith God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 50. 21. He will set our sinnes before us, in order before us; tis a military metaphor; God will muster them before us. For he writes them in a Roll; they are recorded all, that he remits not. At the day of death Sathan will recite them to dismay thee: at least at the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, thy conscience will bewray them to confound thee. Though now it be mute; it will speake then. The conscience of the wicked, though it have haply no remorse; yet it hath remembrance. That will suffice our Saviour at the last day, to indite the sinner to damnation. Nay lightly be it never so benummed by Sathan; shee will show a cast of her office in this life, upon the death bed. For as they say of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, that their familiar spirit leaves them at the layle, and will serve them then no longer: so the devill, that had charmd the conscience all the life, that it could not performe the function, remooves his spell at the approach of death, to drive the sinner to despaire.</p>
            <p>One terme remaines, not toucht as yet, the restlesse importunity of the sinners conscience, checking him uncessantly, My sin (saith <hi>David</hi>) is ever before me. As a good conscience <hi>is a continuall Feast;</hi> so a guiltie is a perpetuall plague. <hi>O semper timidum scelus!</hi> The shadow doth not duelier attend the body, then horrour haunts the sinner. The worme of the conscience never dies. Tis an internall Hell, an eternall Hell. Sinne is in the soule, as a boile is in the body, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Plut.</hi> pricking and shooting and aking continually. <hi>There is no rest</hi> (saith <hi>David) in my body, by reason of my sinnes.</hi> No rest with sinne; none in the day, none in the night. The sinner, like a sick man, turne him on his right side, or turne him on his left, let him tosse and tumble; all is one, <hi>Sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in poena est. Isid.</hi> he finds no ease no way; <hi>wishes in the morning it were night; cries in the night, Oh that it were morning! Dens mandibulae,</hi> the teeth in our chawes stand often still, the Preacher saith, the grinders stand still. But <hi>Dens conscientiae,</hi> as <hi>Gregory</hi> termeth it, the tooth of conscience is biting continually.</p>
            <p>What griefe doth not time ease, doth not time end? This it doth neither. The pleasure of sinne is but for a season, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, and tis but light. But the remorse of sinne, the gnawing of the conscience, is both grievous and long lasting. The delight of it is but (as he saith of affliction) it is but <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap> momentany light. But it hath an eternall waight of sorrow. Wrong done to <hi>Ioseph</hi> by his brethren above 20. yeares before, their conscience brings it afresh unto remembrance. It cryes (saith <hi>Chrysostome</hi>) <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, without pause or intermission. The franticke have their <hi>lucida intervalla,</hi> their rests and respits. The conscience gives the sinner none: but is ever playing <hi>Zipporah</hi> with <hi>Moses,</hi> once bloody husband will not serve, shee must repeate it, and cast her Infants foreskin at his feete. So doth it him, rate and rebuke him <hi>jugiter</hi> continually, and cast his trespasse ever in his teeth.
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:173124:188"/>
               <hi>Paul</hi> bids, <hi>greeve not the spirit:</hi> hee meanes the holy Spirit. Greeve not this spirit neither: else it will greeve thee. Greeve it not once; twill greeve thee often. Not in <hi>Cains</hi> proportion seaven times for once; but in <hi>Lamecks</hi> seaventy seaven times for once. <hi>David</hi> sinned but once, or say twas twice: but his sin was ever before him. It will sue thee every day, pursue thee every where, interrupt all thy businesse, disturbe all thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights. Even when thou sittest feasting with thy friends▪ thou shalt see, or seeme to see the fingers of a hand on the wall before thee, writing the sentence of thy sinne. <hi>Etiam</hi> (saith <hi>Seneca) in solitudine;</hi> bee the sinner where he will, he carries his controller with him, <hi>Peccatraci con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientiae nullus locus tectus, Ambros. Serm.</hi> 46. Hee is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, so <hi>Philo</hi> calls a wicked man; he hath no place of rest: but like <hi>Cain</hi> shifts from place to place, but findes no ease where. The light he loathes; he thinkes his sins in it, not before him onely, but others too. Every eye lookes at him; every mouth speakes of him. The darkenesse hee indures not: that infests him more. <hi>Ipsas nequitia tenebras timet,</hi> darknesse is an horrour to a sinner. Is he to goe forth? <hi>a Lyon is without.</hi> Is he to come home: <hi>Sinne lyeth as the dore.</hi> Especially the man of blood, at bed and board, and every where seemes to see his sinne. In sleepe hee sees his Ghost whom he murthered: and at meat a Fishes head showes him his contenance. If <hi>Herod</hi> heare of Christ, he will cry certainly tis <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi> whom I beheaded.</p>
            <p>To conclude, to purge sinne, thats an act was done but once, done by Christ. But to urge sinne, to upbraid the soule with it, thats an act done daily, done by the conscience. A wise mans heart (saith <hi>Seneca</hi>) I will but change one word, a righteous mans heart is like that part of the world above the moone, <hi>semper illic serenum est,</hi> there is perpetuall lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stre and calme. But the guilty conscience ever lowers, there is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall bluster and unquietnesse. It rates and bates the sinner, <hi>jugiter</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually. Once to rebuk him will not serve; but it sets his sinne ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. But this terme, and the other next before are coucht in that one title, which the Grecians give the conscience; they call it <hi>Alastora.</hi> It neither let sinne lurke, but sets it forth before us: neither let it be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten; it checks it with its <hi>jugiter;</hi> it sets our sinne ever before us. The Lord of his mercy give us ever grace to make conscience of all sin: set it before us when we doe it: but grant us faith to pray for pardon, and to hope for salvation by the sufferings of Christ Iesus, <hi>Cui, &amp;c.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>AVID</hi> enstyles this <hi>Psalme</hi> (as <hi>Tremellius</hi> tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slates it) <hi>excellentissimum,</hi> a most excelling <hi>Psalme.</hi> Two before it, and twelve after it are so entitled too, Psalmes of excellency, All. The sweet Singer in this, having lately received the <hi>Arke</hi> into <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and establisht both Iustice and Religion in his Realme, as the <hi>verses</hi> before show, joyes himselfe, and his People; and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites them in my Text to the wishing of all hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse, and blessing to Gods Church: annexeth a propheticall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> of prosperity to All, that shall love it. Three observable termes, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> an Act, to <hi>Pray;</hi> the Object, <hi>Peace;</hi> the Subject to <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> Of each <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> briefly, and in order. God assist me in them all; for all of them are his. <hi>Prayer</hi> is his right, <hi>Peace</hi> his Gift, and <hi>Ierusalem</hi> his Church. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
            </p>
            <p>First for the Act, its easie; <hi>David</hi> craves a small matter. Prayer is no paines, especially to a prophane person. He but opens his mouth; his browes sweate not, mooves but his lippes onely; haply not so much. Even a godly man sometimes spares his speech too, does but inwardly desire, wishes in heart onely. <hi>Etiam optio, precatio est,</hi> a sigh will serve, if from the Soule. That of <hi>Aquinas</hi> is but an idle <hi>Etymology, Oratio, quasi Oris ratio,</hi> as if Prayer were all vocall. Popish prayer is, many times,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:173124:189"/> as the man said of the Nightingale, <hi>vox est, praeterea nihil.</hi> For their Orysons are Latine lightly, they know not, what they pray. The heart can pray in silence; theres a cry without noyse. God said to <hi>Moses, Why dost thou cry to me?</hi> when he said nothing, that we read. And it is little more, that <hi>David</hi> demands here, as some doe waigh the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word. It is but onely to wish well unto <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> God lookes not at the length, but at the strength of Prayer; nor waighes he the words, but the devotion of him that prayes, not the lungs, but the heart.</p>
            <p>But the word here yet is waighty, not so weake as some make it, to meane but to wish onely; signifies sometimes to pray earnestly. You will thinke <hi>Hannah</hi> vexed, sore vexed by <hi>Peninnah,</hi> upbraiding her with barrennesse, prayed for a sonne heartily, not wisht onely, begd it too, instantly, fervently; fasted and wept, and powred out her soule to God. Yet the Priest there exprest all the power of her pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er but by this word. Surely sometimes <hi>Oratio</hi> is <hi>Aratio,</hi> No act of ease, done (as is said in <hi>Proverbe</hi>) <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, costs no sweate, nor drawes no blood. Prayer does both sometimes, did when Christ prayed, he swet blood, <hi>Supplicatio</hi> is sometimes <hi>Sulcatio,</hi> makes furrowes in the Soule; the eyes burst into teares, and the hands beat on the brest; that the heart shall pant, shall saint with the fervency. Should <hi>David</hi> have craved such a prayer for <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> his zeale would have excused him. But he bids onely pray; but bids that, bids pray, not wish onely; wish too, but pray also. Its in Latine but <hi>Rogate.</hi> That word may seeme but lanke. The Greeke is lanker, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, thats but <hi>Interrogate, Aske how Ierusalem does.</hi> So is it in the <hi>Septuagint.</hi> But the Latine is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, the English too. And I will not censure the zeale of the Author of the old English <hi>Psalmes;</hi> who put in an <hi>Interjection,</hi> to make it more patheticall, <hi>Oh pray for the peace, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What <hi>David</hi> here bids others doe, he does himselfe, does it often. <hi>Be favourable O God to Sion. Deliver Israel, O God;</hi> wisheth <hi>numnesse,</hi> to his hands, <hi>dumbenesse</hi> to his tongue, <hi>if he forget Ierusalem;</hi> prayes her Saints may Rejoyce, and her Priests be clad with Righteousnesse. <hi>Ieremie</hi> laments her hurt, that his eyes faile, and his bowels swell, and his liver melts in him. <hi>Moses</hi> expostulates with God for <hi>Israel, Lord, why hast thou afflicted them?</hi> Intercedes for them to God; prayes to be raced out of Gods booke, rather then they perish; labours so for them in prayer against <hi>Amaleke,</hi> that <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Hur</hi> were faine to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port his weary armes. I omit more examples.</p>
            <p>Did the Iewes thus onely to Gods Church among them? Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans have done the like to his Church too among them, Christians in all ages. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> wisht peace to the <hi>Israel</hi> of God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. ends all his Epistles with wish of grace to them, beginnes them all with grace and peace both; prayes not himselfe onely, but exhorts others too, to supplication for all Saints. Yea and he was not short of <hi>Moses</hi> his zeale too, wisht himselfe <hi>Anathema</hi> for the Churches sake. Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> saith, they used such prayer in his time, Saint <hi>Basil</hi> and <hi>Chrysostom</hi> have it in their <hi>Liturgies;</hi> we in ours often, in the <hi>Letanie,</hi> at the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and in many of the Collects, all Preachers in all Sermons, every man, every religious man at every meale.</p>
            <pb n="344" facs="tcp:173124:190"/>
            <p>It is a very pious office, that <hi>David</hi> here demands, and of great worth, if well performed, Prayer for Gods <hi>Israel.</hi> But we owe unto the Church greater service then so. Prayers are but wishes and words onely. We owe our whole <hi>Posse,</hi> our whole <hi>Esse</hi> to the Church, if cause require: not onely our states, but not our lives excepted. I owe my naturall parent both; then <hi>it</hi> much more. It is pitty, I was borne, if I will not die for her, that bore me. My Country craves of me more then my Parent. Gods Church craves more then it. You heard <hi>Moses</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> proffer a farre greater thing for it then Life is, their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. <hi>Davids</hi> demand here is too moderate; and yet yeelds reasons for it too in this <hi>Psalme;</hi> which I respite to the last terme, to which they belong rather.</p>
            <p>There is a Spirit, that hates the Church, Sathan does; a <hi>Lucian,</hi> that scoffes at it; a <hi>Rabsakeh,</hi> that railes on it; a <hi>Balaam,</hi> that curses it. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans name bewraies him, signifies an Hater: malitiously he workes it all the mischeife, he can. The Atheist laughes at it, <hi>Ridemur,</hi> saith <hi>Tertullian, Decachinnamur,</hi> laughes aloud at it. The Hereticke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches it, reviles and slanders it. The Schismaticke rends it; thats worse. The Iew wisheth it all evill, curseth it heartily. The Pope too, does our Church. The Heathens have persecuted and oppressed it. Romes Emperours have; Romes Bishops have our Church. The Iew though ingendred from the literall <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and prayeth peace on it, hopes to returne to it, yet curseth the whole Christian Church, the mysticall <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> We pitty them, and pardon much to their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staking. The Gentile too, that knowes not what Church meanes, we beare with him. But the Pope we cannot pardon, though he sell par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons to others; God will not pardon him: the Vicar of Christ, the Churches head to curse the Church, the Body of Christ. The enemies of her peace so potent, so numerous, and so neere, give the Churches children good cause to pray zealously for their Mothers peace, the next thing in my Text.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Peace</hi> is a little word, and speld but with few letters: but within the few letters of this little word, are comprised all the blessings, which God bestowes on man, worldly blessings. Peace in proper acception is opposed to publicke hostility, and all private enmity. But the word reaches to all worldly welfare, all earthly prosperity; and <hi>David</hi> meanes so here. Yet Saint <hi>Paul</hi> rests not in it, for all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e large extent; addes to it another word, more excellent then it, <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ce;</hi> conjoynes them; but gives grace precedence, <hi>Grace and Peace.</hi> Grace a diviner gift; it meanes the inward mercies of God, that concerne the Soules happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; wishes them both joyntly to all Churches. But my Text must confine me, my theme is but peace onely. It so pleased God to show his Love to <hi>Israel</hi> in worldly blessings most. But they were his hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels of heavenly things, pledges and types of Grace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>David</hi> had heard of <hi>Israels</hi> many troubles, had seene some. God had chastised them sundry waies. He praies their future Peace in all pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity. <hi>Solomon</hi> his Sonne, who had his name of peace, expounds in his prayer at the Temples dedication, the generall terme of peace, by sundry particulars; Deliverance from the sword, from famine, and
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:173124:190"/> from pestilence, victory in battell, and some more. <hi>Moses</hi> more amply, <hi>Deut. 28. Blessing in the field, and in the City, in the fruite of the wombe, of the ground, and of the cattell; Blessing in the Barne, in the Dough, and in the Basket, Wealth, Honour, Victory,</hi> all felicity. <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> is bold to make this peace, this temporall prosperity, one Note of the Church. Those notes are now growne to a great number, were once but two onely or three, are now fifteene. This is the idlest of all. Wee must ever pray, it may have Peace; but it must not ever looke for Peace. The Church here must not, that in Heaven may.</p>
            <p>Gods Church on earth must be ever militant, ever hath her enemies; if not forraine abroad, yet Intestine at home. <hi>Israel</hi> had the <hi>Egyptian,</hi> and <hi>Assyrian</hi> from afarre, <hi>Moab</hi> and <hi>Ammon</hi> nerer them, the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listim</hi> their next Neighbour. Yea the Church hath sometimes a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent in her bosome; neerer, in her Belly; a viper that will fret, that will eate her wombe asunder. Christ foresees it, foresaith it, <hi>Inimicos domesticos,</hi> foes of her owne family, <hi>Necessarios, Adversarios,</hi> her Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, her Children, disturbers of her Peace. Many stabd <hi>Caesar</hi> in the Senate house; he said nothing. But when <hi>Brutus</hi> smote him; <hi>Etiam tu, Fili,</hi> what thou my Sonne, saith he? The Churches Children oft martyr their owne Mother. <hi>Perditio tua ex te, Israel, Ierusalems</hi> sorrow is from her owne Sonnes. Christs Spouse, <hi>i.</hi> the Church, complaines in the <hi>Canticles,</hi> that her watchmen had wounded her; nay, that the Sonnes of her Mother had molested her. Was the yeare 88 <hi>Mirabilis annus,</hi> a yeare of wonder? They were <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that invaded then, offred to invade▪ 605. was more wonderfull then it, the Gun-powder plot 605. times more wonderfull then it. They were <hi>English</hi> all, that would have acted that.</p>
            <p>But such indeed are not the Churches Sonnes. They are borne on her knees, but not bred in her wombe, Sonnes of the strange woman, the Romish Church. But the Church hath some of her owne seed, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers of her Peace, Pragmaticall Schismaticks, murmurers at <hi>Moses,</hi> like <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> grudgers at <hi>Aaron</hi> too, disgracers, disobeyers, and despisers both of Magistracy and Prelacy, shunners of our assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies; censured by a reverend Bishop of this See, and yet the mildest man that ever sat in it, to be hinderers and slanderers of the Gospel in this Realme more then the Papists. Iudge then whether Prayer for the Churches Peace, be not needfull in our Age.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pray for the Peace. Iehu</hi> once askt, What <hi>Peace? so long as the whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of Iezebel</hi> remaind. But <hi>Israel</hi> was yet a chaste and a pure Virgin. It was wicked <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> that first set them a whoring after strange gods. There was yet no Rent in <hi>Israel:</hi> It, and <hi>Iudah</hi> were one Realme. The Tyranny of <hi>Roboam</hi> first occasioned the revoult. <hi>David</hi> saith in the <hi>Psalme, that all the Tribes together went up unto the Arke, to worship the Lord there.</hi> There was yet no idolatry. Where God is served, God onely; there is Peace. God was served in <hi>Israel</hi> in <hi>Ahabs</hi> time: then lived <hi>Iesabel.</hi> But <hi>Baal</hi> was worshipt too. <hi>Elias</hi> saith the People halted betweene both. But God forbids to have any other gods, but Him▪ They had; and therefore had no Peace. But <hi>Davids</hi> heart was sincere,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:173124:191"/> his, and his Peoples, clave unto God onely. All <hi>Israel</hi> did then. Hee therefore prayes their Peace. Wee will wish peace to <hi>Rome,</hi> though <hi>Iezebel</hi> be there, and her spirituall adulteries. For what else is Idolatry, worship of Images, Angells and Saints? They wish not peace to us; we will to them, to all men, to the whole world. The perfect Christian wisheth hurt to none. But to the household of Faith, the true children of our Mother, the Church of Christ, we wish it especially. Wee will pray, ever pray▪ for the peace of <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> Its the last thing in my Text.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pray</hi> (saith this Princely Prophet) <hi>for the peace of Ierusalem.</hi> I wish; I could expresse the incomparable sweetnesse of this little <hi>Hemestichium.</hi> I ghesse, the holy Ghost was pleased to let the <hi>Psalmist</hi> play the Poet here: the <hi>Psalmes</hi> are holy Poetrie. The Originall words have such elegancie here, as (I thinke) all the Scripture▪ can not parallel this verse. The words doe so excellently answer one another in matchlesse <hi>Paronomasie.</hi> It is in English unexpressible. For the point in hand one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he bids us to pray for the peace of <hi>Ierusalem. Peace</hi> denominates <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> tis the <hi>Etymon</hi> of the word, meanes the <hi>vision of Peace. David</hi> by that terme most sweetly alludes to the name of the Citie. Yet conceales his Art, could have beene more open, have said, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>Pray for the peace of Salem.</hi> For so it was called too, called first so, called still so, <hi>Psal. 76. At Salem is his Tabernacle.</hi> That word meerely sounds peace. God would have his Church the House of peace: and his Temple there, <hi>David</hi> might not build; he was a man of warre: but <hi>Solomon</hi> his sonne, who had his name of peace. Christ, whose the Church is, she his Spouse, would not be borne in <hi>Iulius Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sars</hi> reigne; he was a Warriour too: but in <hi>Augustus</hi> dayes, who reigned in peace. And this may be a Reason too, if you please, why <hi>David</hi> bids pray but for peace onely, an earthly blessing. That word most fitted his Art here, sounded best. But under that word by Poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> couched heavenly blessings too. Come we now to <hi>Ierusalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Very excellent things are spoken of thee, Oh thou Citie of our God.</hi> Even that title is excellent, to be Gods Citie, <hi>the Citie of the great King, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> calls it so, Christ doth too; <hi>The holy citie, Israels glory, the joy of the whole earth.</hi> This <hi>Psalme</hi> commends it for three excellent things, <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, Iustice,</hi> and <hi>Religion.</hi> The Temple the most beautifull fabricke upon earth, the worlds wonder was there, called therefore (as <hi>Eusebius</hi> saith) <hi>Hierosolyma, i.</hi>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, of <hi>Salomons</hi> Temple. A slippe in that learned Fether, not skilled in the Hebrew tongue. No wonder, when <hi>Iosephus</hi> a Iew slipt so before him. But not to mingle Grammar with Divinitie, I omit the <hi>Etymologie;</hi> It skills little. My Theme is not to praise it, but to pray for it. It is here meant in Allegory for the Church of God, as in many other places, called therefore by Saint <hi>Paul, Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem on high,</hi> and the <hi>heavenly Ierusalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sathan hath a Synagogue; thats not <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> It loves not peace. The Dragon and his Angels fight with <hi>Michael,</hi> and his Angels, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 12. The Dragon, the devill; his Angells, Hereticks, all persecutors. These are
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:173124:191"/> not <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> its the vision of peace. <hi>Ierusalem</hi> had sundrie names at sundry times; sometime called <hi>Iebus,</hi> the Iebusite dwelt there. <hi>Salem</hi> afterward: whence Christs Spouse in the <hi>Canticles</hi> is called <hi>Sullamite. Rome</hi> may be <hi>Iebus;</hi> there is the Iebusite, the bloudy Iesuit. But the true Church is <hi>Salem:</hi> her sonnes all are <hi>Sullamites,</hi> lovers of peace.</p>
            <p>It is not the citie, <hi>David</hi> meanes. As it was his chiefe seat, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther citie of the land; he might wish it all peace so. But here he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siders it in a Diviner sense, as the Seat and Citie of the great King. There was the Throne of <hi>David;</hi> tis not for that. But there was the Throne of God; he therefore prayes peace to it. Bishops Sees are in Cathedrall Churches: Gods was in <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> The Temple was his Sanctuarie; Gods selfe calls it his House. You will say, the Temple was not yet, when <hi>David</hi> wrote this <hi>Psalme.</hi> Tis true, the Temple was not; but the Tabernacle was▪ <hi>At Salem was his Tabernacle,</hi> saith the <hi>Psalme.</hi> God vouchsafed to dwell there: tis in the same <hi>Psalme, and his dwelling in Sion.</hi> Gods Inthronization was on the mercy seat, upon the <hi>Arke.</hi> But Temples and Tabernacles made with hands are not the onely houses, that God dwells in. Saint <hi>Steven</hi> tells us that. Mens hearts are Gods house; <hi>The bodies of holy men</hi> (Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith) <hi>are the Temples of the holy Ghost. Davids</hi> selfe, and all the true worshippers of God, which then (I doubt not) were infinite in <hi>Israel,</hi> are meant here by <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> The Cittie (saith the Oratour) are not the walles, streets, and houses, but the people. The Church of God is the Vniversitie of Saints, the whole body of Beleevers. Great was the number of such in that cittie. But all <hi>Israel</hi> besides them, all the males throughout the land, came thrice a yeere to worship at <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> that <hi>David</hi> might justly by usuall trope of speech, partly by Metonymie, and partly by Synecdoche, call Gods whole Church <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> And it is not <hi>Davids</hi> Dialect alone; other Prophets after him title the Church so. [Yea Saint <hi>Paul</hi> too, and Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> in the <hi>Revelation.</hi>]</p>
            <p>But how so? Will some say. Gods Church meant by <hi>Ierusalem?</hi> Said you not, the Church is Christs Spouse, and a <hi>Sullamite?</hi> The one craves Puritie, and the other Peace. Neither suite with <hi>Ierusalem. Esay</hi> calls it in one verse, both an Harlot, and a Murtherer. Nay, both these sinnes are aggravated; the one by <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> Shee was common to all comers, <hi>Opened her feet to every stranger.</hi> [Nay worse, Harlots take hire; she gave.] The second by Christ, a Killer of Gods Prophets; <hi>O Ierusalem Ierusalem▪</hi> But <hi>Distingue tempora.</hi> I did before. <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was not such in <hi>Davids</hi> time: God was served there sincerely all his dayes. In after ages she forgat God, and served Idolls: that was her Harlotrie; and spared not then to murther Gods Prophets. The seaven Churches of <hi>Asia</hi> were the Churches once of Christ: now they serve <hi>Mahomet. Rome</hi> had in it in Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> time, and long after many good Christians; but not so many now. Now <hi>un Christiano</hi> is <hi>Italian</hi> for a foole. <hi>Ierusalem</hi> in my Text is <hi>Societas Sanctorum,</hi> Saint <hi>Austins</hi> terme, the company of holy men: and Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> in the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> takes it ever in that sense, and meanes it of Gods Church. It is Saint <hi>Austins</hi> observation, when <hi>Babylon</hi> is named there, ever understand (saith he) wicked and bloudy men; when <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> holy men: <hi>Babel,</hi> the devills
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:173124:192"/> Synagogue, <hi>Ierusalem</hi> Gods Church. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calls it <hi>Heavenly,</hi> and Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> calls it <hi>New.</hi> New, to distinguish it from that in <hi>Iudea.</hi> Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly, not because it is in heaven, the Church of Saints Triumphant; but because her graces come from heaven. For the Sonnes of God are not borne of flesh and bloud, but of the Spirit. Their generation, <hi>i.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation is from heaven.</p>
            <p>And now one word of Application; <hi>David</hi> bids pray for <hi>Ierusalems</hi> Peace, but whether <hi>Ierusalem?</hi> That surely, which hee here des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribes, where is <hi>Vnitie, vers. 2. Religion, vers.</hi> 4. and <hi>Iustice, vers. 5. Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem is a citie that is at unity within it selfe. Thither go up the Tribes, to praise the Lord: and there are the seats for judgement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is our <hi>Ierusalem</hi> such? Our sinnes shew there is no unity among us; and may we pray for peace on this <hi>Ierusalem?</hi> We may, we must. <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> did for <hi>Israel,</hi> though fallen grievously, <hi>Samuel</hi> for <hi>Saul,</hi> though a grand sinner. Wee may, and must; though haply in vaine. For God saith, <hi>Non est pax, Theres no peace to the wicked.</hi> Sinne at length captiv'd <hi>Israel,</hi> sackt the cittie, raced the Temple; <hi>Nunc seges est,</hi> grasse now growes in <hi>Ierusalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet despaire not daugher <hi>Sion, Returne O Sullamite. There is no peace to the wicked, saith my God;</hi> that is, so long as they be wicked. Cease we to doe evill, sorrow we for our sinnes heartily; weepe we; pray wee God for peace; we shall have peace. The prodigious pride of women, their wanton vanities, censured often by Preachers, but in vaine; they will come with them to Church in spite of us, I thinke in spite of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells too, who are ever present in our Churches; and the drunkennesse of men, their whoredomes and blasphemies, draw downe divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge on our <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> I shall therefore end with a short prayer for our <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> The God of Peace, the Father; the Prince of Peace, the Sonne; the Spirit of peace grant it us.

               <hi>My Sonne.</hi> Tis but a little pronoune, but of great Price; but of two <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> letters in the Latin and our tongue; but one in the originall. A great trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in a small word, <hi>Chrysost. Gods</hi> Sonne? <hi>Gods</hi> any thing is honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. <hi>David</hi> held it a great honour to be sonne to <hi>Saul;</hi> and yet he was but sonne in law to him.</p>
            <p>There is a sonne, whose father is his staine; <hi>Nadab</hi> the sonne of <hi>Iero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam,</hi> that made <hi>Israel</hi> to sinne; the <hi>Hittite,</hi> and the <hi>Iebusite,</hi> and the other sonnes of cursed <hi>Canaan.</hi> A sonne that is disparagd by his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.

Yea <hi>David</hi> was a glory and a grace to Christ. [<hi>Iesabel</hi> though an Adulteresse, an Idolatresse, and Inchantresse, yet <hi>Iehu</hi> bad bury her, as being a Kings daughter.] For us to bee <hi>Gods</hi> sonnes, the Disciple whom Christ loved, with accent even of admiration, bids <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

            <p>Had this Pronominall note not beene exprest, as it is not sometimes; though the name of a Sonne alone be lovely; yet had it lackt much life, beene nothing so significant. To the rich man in hell, a damned ghost, <hi>Abraham</hi> cries <hi>Fili,</hi> but not <hi>Fili mi, Sonne</hi> (saith he) <hi>Remember;</hi> not <hi>my</hi> Sonne. Friend too, a lovely name; but lanke and lame without the Pronoune. To the Guest in the <hi>Parable</hi> without the wedding garment, the King said but <hi>Amice,</hi> not <hi>Amice mi, Friend how camest thou in hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</hi> Christ said so much to <hi>Iudas,</hi> that betrayed him, <hi>Amice, ad quid venisti, Friend wherefore art thou come.</hi> This note is in neither. <hi>Solomon</hi> in his Wisedome waighing the force of it, repeating this title 23. times, hath it ever in this forme, <hi>Fili mi, my Sonne.</hi> This being but a proeme is not to be prosecuted: tis but premised to worke attention and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. The Child owes both to the Parents voice; the termes imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Love, as well as authority: the Fathers counsell ever presumd to be for the Sonnes profit.

Is not <hi>David</hi> cald a man after Gods owne heart? Nor is God like the covetous, who want <hi>tam quod habent, quàm quod non habent,</hi> as well what they have, as what they misse. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> tels the <hi>Athenians, Act.</hi> 17. God needs no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Were he in want; mans heart could not releeve him. Say Love be meant by it; one cannot live by Love. The wanting of it will not make him poore; the having of it will not make him rich. Say, Truth be meant by it, Spirit and Truth. Truth with men is a jewell: but they say, they beg, that use it. Truth is no treasure neither unto God. Be
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:173124:194"/> meant, what can by it: nothing of mans can benefit his Maker. <hi>Davids</hi> goodnesse is nothing unto God. <hi>Psalme</hi> 16. 2. That God bids give it; it is but for acknowledgement; he askes our heart, but for his homage.</p>
            <p>But bids not God else where, <hi>Serva Cor, Keepe thy heart, chap.</hi> 4. 23. Can a man doe both, keepe it, and give it too? and he prefaces it too with the same termes, <hi>My Sonne,</hi> there as well as here. Speakes God <hi>Pugnantia?</hi> what here he craves, doth he there crosse? He doth not. This Text is but a glosse to that. There he bids, keepe the heart; here he showes thee how. The way to keepe it, is to give it him. Sathan craves it too; so doth the world; so doth the flesh. They crave it; but to ruine it. And they all lie in wait for it: give it God; and it is safe. God is the Hearts guardian; he will secure it from them all. Or keepe it, that is, from them, for him. God bidding two things, to keepe, and to give, is thus obeyed in both.</p>
            <p>To end this; Lay the Act to the Object, <hi>Give me thy heart;</hi> and man may say to God, as <hi>Elias</hi> said to <hi>Elisha, thou hast asked an hard thing.</hi> Give away our Selves. <hi>Mens cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>He bids us give them to his service; to love, to feare, to serve him with our hearts, to beleeve on him, and to relie on him. Our hearts given to him so, cease not to be ours. Nay so they are ours the more, more truely ours: more ours, when given to God, then when ours one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Nay, they are not ours at all, unlesse God have them: they are onely ours, when given to him. For if God have them not; Sathan hath them, or the World, or the Flesh. Whose heart they have, any of those three, he is indeed heartlesse, not (as they say) <hi>civiliter,</hi> but <hi>spiritualiter mortuus,</hi> spiritually dead.

It is not my conceit; tis Christs owne speech. A heart dejected towards earthly things, fits a beasts brest rather than a mans. The beasts heart, like his head, lookes to the ground: there is his food; thence is his beginning. Mans affection, like his face, should be <hi>Sublimis,</hi> lifted ever up toward the heavens: thence comes the soule; <hi>God gave it,</hi> saith the <hi>Preacher.</hi> God gave it thee; give it thou to God. God craves but his owne. We are his; for he hath made us; wholie his, heart and all. S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith of body and soule too, that both <hi>are Gods, 1 Cor.</hi> 6. His, by many rights, of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of Redemption, of Obligation: <hi>Iure voti,</hi> wee vowed our selves wholy to him at our Baptisme. There wee renounced all his competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, the World with his Pompe, the Flesh with her Lusts, the Devill with his workes.

            <p>Say we had not: be thy heart yet thine owne: yet bestow it nor on <hi>Belial,</hi> or if <hi>Mammon</hi> cry <hi>Da mihi,</hi> give it not to him. They will but metamorphose it, turne it into stone. Give to to God. If it be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by them, he will reforme it, make it a fleshy heart againe. Much lesse to Sathan: he craves it, but to tread it downe, to trample and
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:173124:195"/> insult on thee. <hi>Incurvare ut transeamus,</hi> lie downe; and as the Pope did on <hi>Fredericks</hi> the Emperour, he will set his foot upon thy necke. Give thy heart to him, that can satisfie thy heart. The World can not, nor the Flesh. The treasures of the one, the more thou hast of them, the more thou hungrest. The pleasures of the other, doe but edge thy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite; they can not quench it. Give God thy heart: looke what thou lustest for, he will give thee thy fill of it. Is it wealth? <hi>Godlinesse,</hi> (Saint <hi>Paul</hi> tells thee <hi>is great gaine,</hi> and the Law of the Lord above thousands of gold. Is it pleasure? <hi>In his presence</hi> (saith <hi>David) is fulnesse of joy.</hi> Is it honour? His <hi>reward</hi> (saith the Apostle) is <hi>a weight of glory,</hi> as much as thou canst beare, <hi>a farre most excellent eternall weight of glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Who lightly gives, but to receive? (<hi>Do, ut des</hi>) gives, but in hope to gaine? Give thy heart to any of the three competitours, tis meerely lost: not it alone, but lightly what thou lookest for besides. Tis not so with God, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Thou losest not thy gift: he will take nought of thee but will requite it. Thou lendst it him, thou givest it not: thou shalt receive thine owne with interest. The other three will promise too, the Flesh, Pleasure, <hi>Mammon,</hi> Wealth, Sathan what thou wilt. But they lie lightly; Say they keepe touch; tis but the more to tempt and entangle thee, and to sinke thy soule into deeper condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
            <p>God askes thy heart; but so, as thy selfe shall have it neverthelesse. Give it the other three, to any one of them, thou losest it. As Christ saith of the life, <hi>That he that loseth it for his sake, findeth it:</hi> but he that feares to hazard it for him, loseth it, in thought to save it. Tis so with the heart, give it to God, and so thou hast it too: tis the more surely thine, the more tis his. Give it any of the other, tis lost utterly, unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverably. The <hi>Prodigall</hi> in Christs <hi>Parable</hi> gave <hi>his</hi> to the flesh, his heart to harlots; is therefore titled the <hi>lost child.</hi> Tis so with Sathan too, and with the world; <hi>Sponde, praestò noxa est,</hi> give, lend, let any thing to either; tis all lost.</p>
            <p>Man becomes heartlesse, when he sinnes. <hi>Ieremie</hi> calls <hi>Judah <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

Onely the righteous can say with <hi>David, Cor meum, my heart,</hi> saith <hi>David</hi> in the <hi>Psalme, Dixit Nabal in corde suo, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal?</hi> See 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. 37. tis said there <hi>Nabals</hi> heart was dead in him, hee had no heart. I know <hi>David</hi> saith too, the wicked have two hearts, <hi>Psalme</hi> 12. but neither of them both their owne. They speake (he saith) <hi>Corde &amp; corde;</hi> but he addes not (<hi>Suo,) With a heart and a heart,</hi> a paire of hearts; but neither theirs. The one is Sathans, the other is the Worlds. Or say the sinner have his heart still, though he give it unto sinne. He hath it <hi>Apud se,</hi> but not <hi>Penes se,</hi> he hath it in his bodie, but not in his power. Doth the Oratour call the bodie the soules jayle, <hi>Carcerem animae?</hi> Tis true of wicked men. Their heart is in their brest, <hi>Tanquam in Pistrino,</hi> saith <hi>Salomon,</hi> as in the devills Bridwell. Tis there, but as a slave, to toile and be tormented. Be it, the sinner hath a heart, as well as the just man: but a Captive-heart, slave to that tyrant, whom he gave it to. Be that then the oddes. Give thy heart to <hi>Belial;</hi> thou hast it still, but tis bond. Give it to God, thou still hast it, and that free.</p>
            <pb n="355" facs="tcp:173124:195"/>
            <p>To end this, Is the sinner yet solicitous to satisfie all suiters? He finds he hath two hearts, the <hi>Psalmist</hi> told him that. He may not deny God. <hi>Cum rogat, jubet:</hi> he but <hi>demands</hi> his heart, he may command it. Hee shall have one. But here in the Lord be mercifull unto his servant, if he give the other to one of the competitours. Or if he have but one in all; yet what if he divide it, <hi>Neque meum, neque tuum, sed dividatur?</hi> Give God alone one moitie; and part the other among the other three. And hath it not three ventricles, as the Anatomists say, a severall cell for every one of them?</p>
            <p>For the first conceit, let it be even so. Let him give one heart to God: and if he find a second, let it give it them. I presume no one man ever had two hearts. I read <hi>Bifrontes</hi> and <hi>Bilingues;</hi> but <hi>Bicordes</hi> I read not. Say one had two, God craves them both. Though here the word be singular, Give me (but) <hi>thy heart;</hi> because one hath but one: yet had he two or moe, all must be Gods. The Law bids love him, <hi>omni cordi tuo.</hi> If thou have many; then with every one. For the second shift of parting it; God scornes, the devill should be halves with him. He will give no part of his glory unto others, <hi>Esay</hi> saith, God loves indeed <hi>a broken</hi> heart, the <hi>Psalmist</hi> saith, but not broken into parts. but a wounded heart he meanes sorry for sinne. The commandement fits here too, <hi>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God, Omni corde, with all thy heart.</hi> Hast thou many? Then with them all. Hast thou but one? Then with all that. Howsoever, yet with all.</p>
            <p>Shall I aske thee that question, which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> askt King <hi>Agrippa? Beleevest thou the Scriptures? I know thou dost.</hi> They teach, theres but one onely God? Why makest thou moe? For to whom thou givest thy heart; he is thy God. Not a God indeed (for God creates man; man can not create God) but a God in thy conceit. Gold is thy God, if thou covet it. Pleasure and Honour if thou dote on them. Thy belly thy god, if thou pamper it. Giving thy heart to any, but to him, that here cries, <hi>Cedo mihi,</hi> give thy heart to mee: against thy consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence thou makest many gods, who knowest, there is but one. Halt not betweene two contrarie Religions. Either be an Idolatour, and give thy heart to whom thou wilt, and denie God, or if thou acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him: repell all his Competitours, and give thy heart to him.</p>
            <p>God craves a gift, cries <hi>Da;</hi> and for himselfe, <hi>Da mihi, Give me,</hi> saith <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> God.

God hath seated them in it; and therefore here puts it for them. Though (as Saint <hi>Austin</hi> saith) <hi>Totum te exigit, qui totum te fecit,</hi> God who made us whole, craves us wholy; yet the Father of Spirits, calls for our spirits specially; and besides the body being but the soules instrument, in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the heart, he hath the body too.</p>
            <p>God craves not the Hand, though an excellent member; not the
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:173124:196"/> Head, a more excellent; not the Tongue, which <hi>David</hi> calls the best member that he had. But the Heart, the Presence chamber of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; the closet of the soule. The heart is Gods House; <hi>Tricameratum, Avicenna</hi> saith, it hath three Cells for all the persons of the Trinity to dwell in. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

            <p>Sathan will accept (rather then faile) of the body onely. He also hungers for the heart, cries (as the King of <hi>Sodom</hi> did to <hi>Abraham) Da mihi Animas, give me the soules.</hi> But hee will take any thing rather than repulse. God the heart, or nothing. The body without it is base: the soule is precious, so called by <hi>Salomon, Prov. 6. 26. David</hi> calls it <hi>his darling, Psal.</hi> 22. But tis Gods Iewell too. The heart is Gods <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilah,</hi> there is his <hi>Bdellium</hi> and his <hi>Onyx</hi> stone. For there is love; the Lodstone both of God and man. Not onely one man craves anothers love: but God doth too. <hi>Magnes amoris amor,</hi> Love drawes love to it, like a Lodstone. He that said it, meant it of mens mutuall love. But it fits here too. <hi>Magnes amoris amor,</hi> love drawes love to it, like a Lode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone. For <hi>God is love,</hi> saith the Disciple, whom Christ loved. And Gods selfe here craves mans love. For thats meant by the heart. Yea heart in the holy tongue, is the same almost in letters, as love is in ours. God therefore askes it. For there is <hi>Fons amoris,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> the fountaine of all love: both <hi>Cupiditatis,</hi> love of worldly things, which made the devill crave it too; and also <hi>Charitatis,</hi> of heavenly things, which makes God demand it here. That affection specially God requires of man, principally; but withall; his feare, his affiance, and his joy, <hi>convertantur</hi> (saith Saint <hi>Bernard</hi>) cast them all on him. They are the heart: <hi>Ibi spera, ibi ama</hi> (saith Saint <hi>Augustine) totum cor,</hi> the whole heart, <hi>Bernard</hi> saith. By <hi>Da mihi cor,</hi> God craves of us all these.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Text is a <hi>Caveat,</hi> to inhibite our Affections (for thats meant by the <hi>Foote</hi>) to looke to our lustes, when wee assemble to serve God. See to them alwayes, but then specially. Foure se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall termes in it; Act and Object, Time, and Place. The Act, to <hi>Keepe;</hi> Object, <hi>thy Foote;</hi> when, at thy <hi>going;</hi> whether? <hi>to Gods House.</hi> Of each briefly, and in order. First, for the Act, <hi>Keepe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All Latin translations have, <hi>Custodi, Keepe.</hi> So hath the last English, and the terme well agrees both with Septuagints, and Originall. Kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, hath many kindes. To <hi>keepe,</hi> is to observe, to preserve, to watch, and otherwise. Christ calls them blessed, <hi>that heare Gods Word, and keepe it; i.</hi> observe, and doe it. This keeping is obedience: <hi>Salomon</hi> meanes not <hi>it. The Foote,</hi> meaning our lustes; wee may not <hi>obey them. O thou keeper of men,</hi> saith <hi>Iob</hi> to God. That keeping is preserving. Nor meanes this Scripture <hi>that.</hi> Lusts neede not cherishing. Pamper them not; hamper them rather. They grow too fast, prosper too well. Carnall men keepe them both these wayes: both obey them, slaves to their lusts; and feede them, Pandars to their flesh. Saint <hi>Iames</hi> saith,
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:173124:197"/> concupiscence tempts and intises us. It needs not: many of us tempt and intise It. Lustes are a Fire, and would be quencht. Wee rather cast oyle on them, to make them flame. To watch, is to keepe too. Thats neare <hi>Salomons</hi> sense. He bids here <hi>looke</hi> to them. That word (mee thinkes) is too weake too. Lock them up; they are Beasts, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, <hi>Plato</hi> saith, wild Beasts. Nay, binde them, make them sure. <hi>Seneca</hi> bids <hi>Indulgere,</hi> bee not too straight, but favour the affections. But thats <hi>honestis affectibus.</hi> Some lusts are lawfull, cherish them: they are not meant here. <hi>Salomon</hi> meanes the wild and unregenerate lusts. They are <hi>Portae mortis,</hi> Saint <hi>Austins</hi> terme, the gates of death. They would be watcht. <hi>Portae inferi;</hi> his terme too, hell gates; looke to them, that they open not. Nay hells selfe, <hi>Animae inferi,</hi> the soules hell, <hi>Macrobius</hi> makes them. If they breake prison, hell is broken loose. <hi>Lactantius</hi> calls them Furies. The Devills plants, saith <hi>August.</hi> Pull them up thou canst not, their roote is so deepe; <hi>Custodi,</hi> keepe them low. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils selfe. What are sinnes, but young Sathans? <hi>Mary Magdalens</hi> se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Devils were but so many sinnes, the Fathers say, tis good keeping Devils downe.</p>
            <p>I sayd this Scripture is a <hi>Caveat. Chilo,</hi> one of the seven Greeke Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, makes two Cavees, <hi>cave tibi, &amp; cave te;</hi> both take heede <hi>to</hi> thy selfe, and beware <hi>of</hi> thy selfe. All danger is not from without, <hi>Hannibal ad portas,</hi> an enemy at the gates; theres an enemy too within thee. <hi>Salomon</hi> meanes it. Theres an Adder in thy bosome. Mine owne af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections fight against my soule, Saint <hi>Peter</hi> saith. <hi>Eve</hi> must egge <hi>Adam;</hi> Sathan will not. Hee will raise him a tempter from his owne Ribbe. Lust is more inward then <hi>Eve.</hi> My Ribbe is but in my side: but my lusts are in my heart. Sathan hath fee'd them to betway mee.

Kill not the affections, quench them not quite. They may live; they must: must and will, while our selves live. But keepe them under. Kill their malice; mortifie them; but as you doe Quick-silver. <hi>Paul</hi> meant no more. Kill them: but how? Not <hi>ut non sint,</hi> but <hi>ut non obsint.</hi> Lust in spight of thee will dwell in thee: but let it not reigne in thee. Let the lust live: but purge the Leven out of it. Let the Serpent live, so the sting be out.</p>
            <p>To end this; the <hi>Foote</hi> needes keeping. For (as Saint <hi>Iames</hi> saith) <hi>In multis offendimus, wee trip often.</hi> Nay we fall often, not trip onely, fall (<hi>Salomon</hi> saith) seven times a day.

But <hi>Solomon</hi> implies it in the foote. For so it followes in the verse, be more neare <hi>to heare.</hi> To heare, is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall end of the assemblies; and a man of foule feete, <hi>i.</hi> of impure pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, of unholy affections, is a bad hearer.

            </p>
            <p>Meanes the Foote the affections? How saith Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> then, <hi>Pedes tui, Charitas tua est,</hi> Our Feete, are our Love? How are they then our Lusts? The foote is both in Scripture metaphor. And Saint <hi>August.</hi> cleares himselfe elsewhere by distinction. The foote, <hi>cum rectus est, amor est; cum pravus, libido;</hi> when tis straight, tis love; when croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, then tis lust. And yet love is a lust too, a lawfull lust; many lusts are so. The same Father saith too, <hi>Pedes nostri, affectus nostri,</hi> in <hi>Psal.</hi> 94. The feete meane the affections, whether good or bad. The Soule by them walkes as it were, as the body doth by the feet. They are the Soules feete.</p>
            <p>I condemne not all affections. Stoicks did. The Soule hath them from God; they are good from him. Christ had his Passions, of all kindes, Love, Anger, Sorrow, Ioy: some of them vehement too some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times: <hi>Longd to eate the Passeover, desiderando desideravi.</hi> Grieved, that he wept againe.

These feet, cleane by Creation, faire at the first, Sathans foote hath trod on, and defiled.

            <p>The time and place follow, when and where the Preacher bids us, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> keepe our feete.

The whole earth is Gods house; the heavens are more. Thats not meant here: But the Temple, the place of the peoples assembly, to the service of God. <hi>Domus mea, domus orationis,</hi> the house of Prayer is the house of God. The very English name of Church, deriv'd (schollers say) from the Greeke, and the Scotish terme more plainly, signifies the place to belong unto the Lord. The Church is <hi>Peniel, Gen.</hi> 32. the place of Gods presence, <hi>Shagnar el, the gate of God, Gen. 28. Beth el, the house of God; Iacob</hi> cald it so. Looke to thy feete there, to thine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane affections; lest thou make it <hi>Bethaven,</hi> the house of wickednesse, as <hi>Iudah</hi> did, <hi>Ose.</hi> 4. 15.</p>
            <p>Looke to thy lusts ever, every where: but in the Church, Gods cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Presence chamber, looke to them there specially. The greatest subject bares his head in the Kings Presence-chamber. Bare thou thy Feet in Gods; put off thy shooes there, tis holy ground.

            <p>The Rabbins write, that the Priests did all things barefooted in the Temple. Not Priests onely, people too in most easterne Churches, put off their Sandalls at the porch: no shooe may come upon the holy pavement. Turkes may teach Christians holy duty; not to dare enter into Gods house, tread in his Courts, but with awe and reverence of his sacred presence: to put off every shooe, every foule affection, when they come to worship God. <hi>Levit. 26. 2. Templum meum revereberis.</hi> Will <hi>Paul</hi> have womens heads covered in the Churches, because of the Angels? and shall I not cover my feete, my loathsome lusts, because of Gods selfe? Or doubt I of Gods presence, because I heare God is in Heaven? He is; but in the Temple too. Saint <hi>Steven</hi> saith, he is not, dwels not in Temples made with hands. The Martyr meanes, God is not tyed to it. Nor is God tyed to heaven. <hi>Salomon</hi> expounds <hi>Steven; the heaven of heavens conteine him not.</hi> So the Temple confines him not. Yet is hee in it, tis his house. Hospitalls, houses built but for the poore, are called <hi>Maison-dieus, i.</hi> Gods houses. The Temple is much more. What booke almost in the whole Bible, but calls it so? All Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are not, the Turkes <hi>Melchites,</hi> the Iewes Synagogues▪ and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens Temples; Sathans house rather. But Christian Churches are Gods house, and God is in them. Gods selfe saith, <hi>Where but two or three are as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled in Christs name, God is there:</hi> much more in the places of fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Congregations. <hi>David</hi> calls it <hi>Gods dwelling, Psal. 132. the place of his rest,</hi> and the seate of his Residence. <hi>Here will I dwell,</hi> saith God.</p>

               </gap>, let no ungodly man come where God is. The Greeke is more significant, and was writ over the gate of the Temple in <hi>Epidaurus,</hi> Let no prophane thing come where God is. I will not be so strict; and yet I may: not Hawke or Dog should come into the Sanctuary. Into the Iewes Temple none did, Rabbins say. That they doe into our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, to the great disturbance both of Preacher and people; tis no honour to Church discipline. Might our feete, that is our lusts bee left at home so easily as they: wee should not bring <hi>them</hi> with us neither. <hi>Salomon</hi> bids therefore, not leave them, but looke to them. Have them wee may; but inhibite them wee must, when wee come into Gods house. I shall haply please lesse; but I shall profit more, If I shall be more particular.</p>

               <hi>David</hi> gives instance of one foote, <hi>Psal. 36. Pes superbiae,</hi> the foote of pride. Thats a foote too frequent in Gods house. Many come thither <hi>Spectatum, &amp; ut spectentur,</hi> to see, and to be seene; to learne vanity, and to teach it. Thy seemeliest garment well beseemes that place, especially on Gods holy day. Honour Gods house and day, even with thy best ornaments. But pride not thy selfe in the cover of thy shame: weare what thou wilt, that is fit. But looke to thy heart, that pride have no foote in it.

Those eyes, which in prayer should bee lifted up to heaven, or in Preaching, be fixed on the Prophet, dost thou draw them from holy office to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy use?

I will not bee too longe in this: because others late follies have fairely beene reformed.</p>
            <p>Theres <hi>Pes libidinis;</hi> a foule foote indeede, to tread on holy ground, unchast lust. Women most trespasse in the other, Men in this. Theres a sinnew in Mans eye, in no creatures else, (Anatomists say) cald <hi>Nervus precatorius,</hi> a Nerve for the nonce, to use in Prayer▪ to lift the eye to Heaven. But theres in many an eye, even in Gods house, <hi>Nervus Fornicatorius,</hi> a wanton sinnew, an Adulterous eye, Saint <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> terme. This Foote I would not now have named; had there not lately in this Temple, not an eye, but a hand, in Gods holy house, an unholy hand, lewdly trespast in this kind. If such a <hi>Zimri</hi> scape uncensur'd <hi>Phinees</hi> is to blame. Twas once a wonderment in <hi>Athens, Bos in civitate,</hi> an Oxe in the Citie?

               <hi>Pes Avaritiae</hi> is a foote too, that founders often in the Temple. The lust of lucre distracts many a hearer. His minde is on his Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, his Bargaines, and his Bondes, in the most of his devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. His thoughts are Thornes, Christ saith: Gods Word is choakt with them.</p>
            <p>The foote of ambition hath the same fault. Theres a Thorne in that foote too. Prayer craves, <hi>sursum corda,</hi> bids me lift up my heart. I doe; but to honour, not to heaven.</p>
            <p>Theres a fouler Foote then this, the Foote of malice, the foulest of all lusts, and the unfittest for Gods house. Prayer, Sermon, or Sacrament, this foote defiles all: does more, defeats them, makes them uselesse: does worse, workes them all to our hurt. Pray I God to pardon mee, as I doe others? and doe I malice them? Then crave I vengeance on my selfe. Come I to heare? Haply I hate the Preacher. His censure of my sinne, will har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den my heart more. Come I to the Sacrament? and am I not in charity? I take Christs body to my bane; his blood to my damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Malice and envy (saith <hi>Clemens Alexand.</hi>) come not within Gods Quire, <hi>Strom. 5. p.</hi> 239. 40.</p>

Say they scape the Wolfe; the Butcher catcheth them. Nay their lives sufficed not neither; but as the Tragicke saith, <hi>Rudis est Tyrannus, morte qui poenam exigit,</hi> he is but a young Tyrant, that punisheth by death. It was a worke of wit to devise waies to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture them.</p>
            <p>What say I, <hi>Christs</hi> Church? the Church was ancient, before twas called Christs; <hi>hesterni sumus,</hi> the Apostles were but Punees. The Crosse began long before the Gospell. <hi>Israel</hi> felt it under the Law. <hi>David, Elias,</hi> both forc't to flye, both their lives sought. <hi>Daniel</hi> in the denne, <hi>Ieremie</hi> in the dungeon. <hi>Syria</hi> thresht <hi>Israel</hi> with iron flailes. Yea before the Law also, even in <hi>Adams</hi> daies, long before <hi>Israel,</hi> when there scarce was any to persecute, but foure persons in the world, yet this Sunne lookt on one of them. <hi>Abel, Noah, Abraham,</hi> whosoever was a zealous worshipper of God, found some sonne of <hi>Belial</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blacke him in some kinde or other. Gods Church in all ages hath had <hi>Pharaoes</hi> and <hi>Neroes: facies ejus, sicut nigredo Ollae,</hi> as the Prophet speakes, her face has beene as the blacknesse of a pot.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mizraim,</hi> and <hi>Ashur,</hi> the servitude ef <hi>Egypt,</hi> the captivity of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> set a deepe dye of cole-blacke on the Iewish Church. And Christs Church, all Christian Churches the Sunne has lookt on them. Not one
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:173124:201"/> hath been hid from the heate of it. And how blacke that heate, that fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry heat hath burnt them, you may both heare and see. In this Temple, as you passe to and fro this place in <hi>most</hi> Churches remaine the monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Churches blackenesse. Not by the hands of heathens on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the <hi>Gothes,</hi> the <hi>Hunnes,</hi> the <hi>Vandals,</hi> the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> not by <hi>Gog</hi> onely, but by <hi>Magog</hi> too: <hi>Ephraim</hi> by <hi>Manasses.</hi> The Churches owne brethren, <hi>the Sonnes of her Mother were angry against her, ver. seq.</hi> Christs Church in our land, in the dayes of our Grand-fathers, how grievously hath it groned under the Crosse? God hath given it a long rest; the Sunne hath long beene set, not lookt on us a whole halfe hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares. Never may it rise againe. And yet it beares a kinde of Crosse even now. The blacke mouthes of our Adversaries, how doe they denigrate the name of our Church? and the tongues persecution Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> reckons worse then the sword. Blacke they will have it, though it be but with inke. The devill the blacke prince, ever hath, ever will, blacke the Churches face one way or other. Shee is <hi>Naomi,</hi> that is, faire, but the Crosse hath made her <hi>Marah,</hi> that is, bitter, <hi>Lilium,</hi> but <hi>inter Spinas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To end this, affliction is the Churches portion, her portion on earth. Christ hath promised her a Crowne; but the Crosse must goe before. He that will weare the one, must beare the other. Princes Crownes have a Crosse over them; but Christs hath one under it. Christs selfe ascended by mount <hi>Olivet</hi> to Heaven: but he first ascended mount <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vary</hi> to the Crosse. So must all his Members. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, their way to Heaven is through many tribulations. No man exempted; Patriarkes, Priests, Prophets, Apostles, Christs owne selfe, all have felt the beames, the blacke burning beames of persecution. Every member of the Church, Head, and all, hath had his part, <hi>Vnus sine peccato, nullus sine flagello;</hi> One once found quit of sinne, never any of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Qui non est Crucianus, non est Christianus, Luther.</hi> The Church is browne: how can shee choose, the <hi>Sunne having lookt on her.</hi> Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is a Fire. <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 49. Persecution is a Furnace, <hi>Esa.</hi> 48. 10. It must needes burne them blacke, stocke-blacke, cole-blacke, that light in it. Enough of the Tanne; now to the Morphew. <hi>I am Blacke,</hi> saith Christs <hi>Spouse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other cause of the swarthnesse of the Church, is <hi>Sinne.</hi> That <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> first was no wonder, that shee should be parched, that she should be scorched by the Crosse. Gods Selfe put enmity betweene the Serpents seed, and <hi>Eves.</hi> The Church is from her; Persecutors from him. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than is their Sire; Christ saith it. <hi>You are of your father the devill.</hi> His Sonnes have that power to bruise her heele, that the venome of their teeth doe discolour all her skinne. But that sinne should bemorphew her, sinne blacke that body, whereof Christ is head, may seeme to some a mervaile. Not to be Sunne-burnd onely, <hi>ut ver. seq.</hi> but sinne-burnd too; her skinne be blackt by Sinne, the Ioy of Christs eyes, and the Spouse of his Bosome, his Dove, his Love, his Faire-one, sounds somewhat improbable. Is not Holines one of the Notes of the Church? not of <hi>Bellarmines</hi> fifteene, but of the foure principall in the <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi> Creeds? nay, one of the two, the first of the two, even in the
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:173124:202"/>
               <hi>Apostles</hi> Creed; or because some have questioned the credite of the Creed, is it not <hi>Pauls</hi> terme, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 27. And what fellowship can there be betweene Belial and Christ, Holinesse and Sinne? But in this first terme of my Text, we are to consider the Church within her selfe, not what shee is in Christ. Not that complexion which shee hath by Grace, but the constitution, which she hath by nature.</p>
            <p>The Church is the company of Gods Elect indeed. But they are all <hi>Adams</hi> sonnes, <hi>Eves</hi> daughters all. Himselfe was blacke, when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat them; and shee, when shee conceiv'd them. Thornes bare no grapes; the seed of sinners, and so they sinners too, sinners all. Not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny sonne of man, saving the Sonne of Man, but is a sinner. Papists ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Christs Mother; his Grandmother some too; some S. <hi>Francis</hi> too▪ But you heard Saint <hi>Austins Vnus sine peccato;</hi> he exempts but one. Was not that one Saint <hi>Francis?</hi> And his terme too is masculine, <hi>unus</hi> not <hi>una.</hi> Christs Mother, and his Grandmother, Saint <hi>Marie</hi> and Saint <hi>Anne</hi> might be no sinners for all that. But <hi>Salomon</hi> (as it chanceth) cleares that doubt. 1 <hi>King. 8. Non est homo, qui non peccet; that</hi> terme takes women too. Vnlesse they will haply cavill at the Relative, <hi>Non est homo qui,</hi> and so to meane men onely. But (as happe is) Christs Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath appeacht her selfe; she calls her Sonne her Saviour; <hi>My Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> (saith shee) <hi>rejoyceth in God my Saviour.</hi> Aske the Angell what that is, <hi>Matth.</hi> 1. 21. Christ should be called <hi>Iesus,</hi> that is to say, a <hi>Saviour;</hi> because he should save his people from their sinnes. Christ was not <hi>Maries</hi> Saviour, if <hi>Mary</hi> had no sinne.

            <p>Wee blesse that sacred vessell of grace above all women, for her Sonnes sake; we honour her memory, and we Saint her name▪ But we dare not robbe the Sonne, to enrich the Mother. That happie prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, to be quit of sinne, wee appropriate to Christ. Christs selfe is white and ruddie, both the colours of Beauty, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 10.

Not the sonnes of men onely, <hi>Cains</hi> seed, but the sonnes of God also, Christs Church. There is not a Saint, but hath beene a sinner. It is but some Frier, that excepts Saint <hi>Francis.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>Lot,</hi> the Scripture calls <hi>Iust</hi> men; but it notes some spots in them, So doth it in <hi>Abraham,</hi> and in his Sonne, and Sonnes Sonne; very foule ones in <hi>Iacobs</hi> sonnes; in <hi>David,</hi> in <hi>Peter. Paul</hi> calls himselfe
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:173124:202"/> the <hi>chiefe of sinners.</hi> Saints have beene sinners? Nay Saints are sinners. Saints in heaven have beene; Saints in earth are. The best is but a Briar▪ the justest but a Thorne, the Prophet saith. Their spots both foule and many. <hi>Mary Magdalens</hi> seaven devills, what were they but seaven sinnes? Devills, that is, foule; and seaven, that is, many. <hi>Davids</hi> foule too, he calls it <hi>great, Psal.</hi> 25. and many, hee saith, they were moe than the haires of his head. Nay not their imperfections, their infirmities a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, cast a morphew on the Church: but their perfections too, make her, if not blacke, yet browne. <hi>Imperfecta est perfectissima perfectio,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Bernard.</hi> Our very righteousnesse is as <hi>a stained clout.</hi> This is the Churches naturall constitution: Come we now to her Complexion; <hi>Nigra sum, sed decora,</hi> a Negro by nature, but an Angell by Grace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I am blacke, but comely.</hi> This blacknesse in Christs Spouse is grac't <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> here yet with comelinesse. Beautie consists not all in colour. Sweetnesse of countenance, and apt feature of the parts make the person beautifull. Her Eyes, her Temples, her Necke, her Hands, her Brests, all her other members, Christ here describes their excellent proportion; &amp; in appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, in admiration of them all, cries, <hi>Ch. 4. v. 7. Tota pulcraes,</hi> thou art all faire, my love, and there is no spot in thee. Browne she is, but amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, blacke, but of such beauty, that he surnames her <hi>Shullamite,</hi> that is, a woman of perfection, and peeres her to the Starres, the goodliest of them all, <hi>fire as the Moone; pure as the Sunne, Chap. 6. vers.</hi> 9. and as ravisht with the rarenesse of her beautie, calls her the <hi>fairest among women,</hi> 5. 9.</p>
            <p>But this fairenesse, this purenesse, this excellent perfection is not of her selfe. The Churches comlinesse comes all from Christ; tis dative, not native. Bodily beauty, <hi>Nulla nisi abs te,</hi> Saint <hi>Austine</hi> saith, tis all from God. Tis spirituall much more. She is <hi>faire as the Moone.</hi> But the Moones beautie is from the Sunne. Christ is the Sunne, <hi>Sol justitiae,</hi> saith the Prophet; her beautie is his bountie. Twas from the Sunne she had her blacknesse too; shee said, shee was browne, for the Sunne had lookt on her, <hi>Sol nequitiae,</hi> the Sunne of wickednesse. But her beautie is from Christ, <hi>Sol justitiae,</hi> the Prophet <hi>Malachies</hi> terme, the glorious Sonne of righteousnesse. The Virgins, that were to goe in to King <hi>Assuerus,</hi> must first be purified with oyles and odours. Christ beares af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to the Church, meanes to espouse her; but she must be fitted first, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 2. fitted, and then presented: but prepared first, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> saith, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 21. 2. as a Bride trimmed for her husband.</p>
            <p>Her selfe is blacke; nay to say the truth, hard favoured too, yea ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>featured too. Saith shee, shee is <hi>Decora,</hi> (or as some Bookes have) <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosa,</hi> beautifull and comely? Surely there is not either <hi>Forma</hi> or <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cor,</hi> the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> saith, neither beauty nor shape in her. He spake it of her Spouse in his humiliation; but tis true too, more true of her. Nothing in her lovely of her owne. Nor hath shee friends to set her forth. Her Father an <hi>Amorite,</hi> and her Mother an <hi>Hittite.</hi> Nothing to commend her, Countrey, Parts, Dowry, Birth, nor Beauty. Christ is faine to furnish her with all. And in some countries Husbands give dowries to the Wives, the old <hi>Germains</hi> did, and some parts of <hi>Spaine▪</hi>
               <pb n="370" facs="tcp:173124:203"/> so Christ doth to his Church. All his Spirits graces he endowes her with, and all his owne merits he adornes her with. Hee doth not, as the man saith in marriage, to the woman, <hi>With my body I thee worship.</hi> Christ doth worship to the Church, he honours her with his Spirit. He finds her not blacke onely, but foule too: he purgeth her with Hysope, and so she is made cleane; hee washeth her, and so shee is whiter than snow, As God did <hi>Iehosuah</hi> in <hi>Zacharies</hi> vision, so doth Christ the Church, strippes her of her filthy garments, and puts new robes on her, even his owne robe of righteousnesse. Cloathed with <hi>it</hi> though browne, yet shee is faire, without all imputation, but by imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>As in <hi>Paul,</hi> so in <hi>All, there dwelleth no good thing.</hi> But <hi>tua Bona, Dei Dona, August.</hi> all goodnesse is from God. Christs Spouse is comely, full of grace. But mans grace is from Gods Grace. Love, Peace, Long-suffering, Gentlenesse, Ioy, Goodnesse, Faith, Meekenesse, Temperance, all the Sisterhood of vertues, they are (Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith) the fruits of the Spirit. Christ gives his Spouse, his Spirit, and so with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all these graces. They are all Gods <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, his franke and free be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowings. She is glorious, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith; all glorious, the <hi>Psalmist</hi> saith: but <hi>shee</hi> is glorious, because <hi>hee</hi> is gracious. The beauty, glory, comelinesse, whatsoever grace shee hath, shee hath of him. They are <hi>Donata,</hi> not <hi>Innata,</hi> not naturall perfections, but the largesse of Christs love.</p>
            <p>To end this; the Churches comelinesse comes by two things, Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and Sanctification. God hath conferred on her all the graces of his Spirit; and faith hath conveied to her all the righteousnesse of Christ. Hee the <hi>Sonne of righteousnesse</hi> you heard called by the Prophet; and this the woman in the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> cloathed with this <hi>Sunne.</hi> These two containe the perfection of all beautie. Let it seeme no wonder, that God so loves the Church. Righteousnesse and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse are they not Gods owne Image? He sees his Sonne in her; hee sees himselfe in her. It were a wonder, if God should not affect her, so qualified, so beautified. His affection so strong to her, that he vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safes to marry her to his owne Sonne, owne and onely. His Sonnes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection such to her: that he praises her, but in a stile passing all the Art of man: Is in love with her, in deepe love with her, his heart wounded with her eyes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. 9. but with the one of her eyes; but so ravished with both, that <hi>Chap. 6. vers.</hi> 4. he entreates her to turne her eyes aside, for he is overcome with love, and in the strength of this love, embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth her; kisseth her; calls her by all lovely names, and repeates them often; his <hi>wel beloved,</hi> his <hi>undefiled,</hi> his <hi>sister, Spouse,</hi> his <hi>Dove,</hi> his <hi>Love</hi> his <hi>Faire</hi> one; <hi>yea the fairest of all women.</hi> Well may she, and with modestie, especially provok'd, call her selfe <hi>Comely,</hi> whom the fairest among men calls the fairest among women. Comely is but a <hi>Terminus diminuens;</hi> she might have assumed somewhat more unto her selfe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing disgrac't by others. But as Christ saith in the Gospell, he that hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles himselfe shall be exalted; so hee doth here with her. He turnes (Comely) into (Faire,) <hi>formosa mea, his</hi> Faire, and that not as her fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, but <hi>most</hi> Faire, <hi>fairest among women.</hi> Yea and yet more than that,
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:173124:203"/> not blacke <hi>and</hi> Comely, as shee said in her modestie, browne in face, but comely else in body; but <hi>tota pulcra, all faire.</hi> Blacke in her owne eyes, and in her humility, and haply in some others, in disdaine; but faire in Gods eye, all faire in Christs. For God will see no blacknesse in his Saints; he reputes them <hi>all</hi> faire. In Heathens haply, and some easie Christians, there is <hi>some</hi> beauty; many of their actions, though sinnes, because not done in Faith, yet <hi>Splendida peccata,</hi> beautifull sinnes. But the Church, the true Church is <hi>Lilium inter spinas,</hi> as a <hi>Lillie among Thornes</hi> to them; <hi>the fairest among women.</hi> Not blacke and beautifull, but wholly beautifull; <hi>without spot,</hi> saith <hi>Paul,</hi> without <hi>wrinkle; Tota pulcra es,</hi> thou art <hi>all</hi> faire, my love, and there is no spot in thee.</p>
            <p>Now then come we to you, <hi>yee Daughters of Ierusalem,</hi> lookers on all this love betweene the Church and Christ, but with an emulous eye. What God calls holy, let no man call prophane. Twit not the Church your sister with her blacknesse. Her selfe confesses it. For all her blacknesse, she is faire. Hold your selves a glasse; see what your co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour is, <hi>Albus an Ater,</hi> whether better than Christs Spouses. <hi>Amster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> daughters of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> for I will not envie you that stile, though you doe us. Nor grudge wee you the title of Gods Church; <hi>Israel</hi> hath beene in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the daughter of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> in the daughter of <hi>Babylon.</hi> Nor doubt I, but that <hi>many</hi> of you have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance in heaven, though you hold not <hi>any</hi> of us. Separists and Romanists, Recusants both, shunners of our Communion, and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of our Church, with no zeale, and much wickednesse. We are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed blacke, both by the Crosse; thankes to you for that, your Sunne hath lookt on us; and by sinne, too blacke. But not so cole-blacke, not so hell-blacke, as you make us. You belike as <hi>Iehu</hi> said to the men of <hi>Iezreel,</hi> you are righteous. For <hi>Loripidem rectus,</hi> he should be wise, that will call his fellow foole.</p>
            <p>You both are white. First for them of <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> they are all pure; new Separists, old Chatharists. And yet whence should they be white? Pride is blacke fac't, Schismes mother; and I am sure their Sire was Browne. But be they, as <hi>Iob</hi> said to his friends <hi>soli homines,</hi> the onely men: like <hi>Pupianus</hi> in <hi>Cyprian, Solus Sanctus, solus integer,</hi> they the sole Saints on earth. That schismaticall Arch-hereticke <hi>Basilides</hi> would boast so, <hi>Nos sumus homines, cateri, canes &amp; sues.</hi> No Saints, but <hi>his</hi> Disciples, nay no <hi>men,</hi> but they, all others dogges and swine. <hi>Totus mundus apostatavit,</hi> the old <hi>Donatists</hi> saying, not a faithfull Christian in all the world, saving at <hi>Amsterdam.</hi> What we heare of them, I will not publish. I will not say so much, as blacke is their eye. I passe by them in pitty.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Rome</hi> to challenge <hi>England,</hi> to checke our Church with black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, being such a Blouze her selfe, <hi>Quis tulerit Gracchos?</hi>—a Gypsie should not mocke a Iew. Yours is the holy Mother Church, yours is the holy Father Pope. Nay a single <hi>Sancta,</hi> will not serve your Church; you stile it <hi>Sacrosanctam,</hi> the holy holy Church. Nor (holy) in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive satisfie your Bishop, you title him <hi>Sanctissimum,</hi> a superlative Saint. What then meant <hi>Mantuan? Roma est jam tota Lupanar;</hi> the whole city a stewes? Twentie eight thousand Courtisanes at once in <hi>Rome.</hi>
               <pb n="372" facs="tcp:173124:204"/> And how have some of your holy Popes, beene Murtherers and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurers? For Adulterers, thats a small matter: how have too many of the sacred Pontifices beene monsters of men. <hi>Etiam Saul inter Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas?</hi> What <hi>Hildebrand</hi> become a Saint? Once it was a Proverbe, A young Saint an old Devill. But then, an old Devill, a young Saint, <hi>Garnet</hi> a Traitour too, a complotter of the ruine of his King and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, let him goe in and be canonised a Saint. Is this your whitnesse, <hi>yee daughters of Ierusalem.</hi> White you are indeed, and ruddy, like the Churches Spouse: but white with Leprosie, red with bloud. God keepe our Church, Christ keepe his Spouse from such complexion: and purge us of our blacknesse, that so we may be comely in his fight, that so loved us, as that he gave his onely begotten Sonne for us, to whom with his holy Spirit be all honour, &amp;c.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>O saith the Prophet <hi>Ieremiah</hi> to <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi> requiring among other of the fruits of their repentance, to <hi>sweare</hi> by Gods Name. Saint <hi>Iames</hi> bids, <hi>sweare not,</hi> Gods servant; nay Christ bids, <hi>sweare not,</hi> Gods Sonne: And saith the Prophet here, <hi>Iurabis, thou shalt sweare?</hi> Tis a word had neede be prefac't with a <hi>Dixit Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> in the verse before, the Lord saith, <hi>thou shalt sweare.</hi> And yet tis harsh so too. For doth God command what Christ prohibits? <hi>Nolite jurare, I say, sweare not,</hi> saith Christ. Bids God, what Christ forbids? the Sonne contradict the Father? Here a <hi>Dicit Dominus,</hi> for the affirmative, thou <hi>shalt</hi> sweare; and <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 34. a <hi>Dicit Dominus</hi> too, for the negative, thou shalt <hi>not</hi> sweare? Christ sayd, his Father and himselfe were <hi>one,</hi> one as in substance, so in sentence. It seemes they are two here. What grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter variance, then contradiction? Well yet, God bids it, thou <hi>shalt</hi> sweare; thou mayst, thou must. But because swearing is subject to much <hi>Soloecisme,</hi> there are many falls in it, saith Iesus <hi>Sirach.</hi> I say much
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:173124:205"/>
               <hi>Soloecisme,</hi> both in the forme of oath, and in the swearers disposition; first he <hi>defines</hi> the forme, it shall bee, <hi>The Lord liveth;</hi> and then <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines</hi> the affection: <hi>sweare</hi> thou shalt, but not falsely, but <hi>in truth;</hi> not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> idlely, but <hi>in judgement;</hi> not wickedly, but <hi>in righteousnesse. Thou shalt</hi>

               <hi>sweare, the Lord liveth, in truth, in judgement, and in righteousnesse.</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Five distinct particulars by Gods assistance, and your patience, to bee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> severally considered. For the first, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sweare,</hi> God saith oft of himselfe, <hi>Audite me, heare mee;</hi> and he sayd <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> once of his Sonne, <hi>Audite ipsum, heare him.</hi> Tis fit wee heare them both: for wee are Boths, both Gods, and Christs. But when one bids, what the other forbids; the Father bids in the Law, what the Sonne forbids in the Gospel; whether shall wee heare? for we cannot heare them both. To heare God say, <hi>thou shalt;</hi> but Christ say thou <hi>shalt not;</hi> this would make a man a <hi>Manichee.</hi> For this very cause the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichees</hi> rejected the old Testament, both the Law and Prophets; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they warrant oathes. Let us therefore first accord thus contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. The Sonne hath reconcild the Father unto us▪ let us recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile the Sonne unto the Father. Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> saith, <hi>he saw a warre in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> But it was not betweene the persons of the Godhead: there is no warre, no jarre betweene <hi>them;</hi> all the Trinitie is at unitie. Shall wee flie for this accord to that rule of the Divines; <hi>Distingue tempora, &amp; concordabunt Scripturae,</hi> distinguish but of times, and repugnant Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures will agree. <hi>Theophylact</hi> doth so. He saith, twas lawfull to sweare then under the Law; but it is not now under the Gospell. <hi>Moses</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded it, but Christ countermanded it. In so much that many Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs have refused to sweare before the Magistrates. They would say a Christian might not sweare. Or shall wee say God speakes not <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptivè</hi> here, but <hi>Permissive</hi> onely; not thou shalt sweare; but thou mayst? So is Saint <hi>Hieroms</hi> judgement, that oathes and sacrifice were but meere Indulgences, permitted to the Iewes of policie. They heard the Gentiles sweare by <hi>their</hi> Gods, and saw them sacrifice to all the hoasts of heaven. God was content, <hi>they</hi> should doe both, so they did it unto him. Not that either pleased him, but to preserve them from Idolatry.</p>
            <p>The one saith, tis no precept; the other saith, it is, but for a time. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Fathers both; but I may not rest on either. For if (as Saint <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> thought) oathes are permitted onely, not injoynd: then may I sweare, but I may choose. Then will I be an Anabaptist; the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate shall not force me to an oath. And if God injoynd oaths, but for a time, <hi>Theophylacts</hi> opinion; then swearing is Iudaisme: a Christian to sweare, is as absurd, as to bee circumcisd: for hee makes them par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allels. An excellent protection for a Iesuited Papist to refuse the offer of the oath of Allegiance: what? will the Iudge make him a Iew?</p>
            <p>Surely to sweare is not a bare permission, but a Law; a Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not an indulgence. Though some Scriptures be ambiguous, and may as well be construed <hi>Permissivè</hi> as <hi>Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="375" facs="tcp:173124:205"/> cavill this Text too; and say, that both the <hi>Septuagints,</hi> and the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphrast translate it otherwise: yet those places in <hi>Deuteronomie,</hi> 6. 13. and 10. 20. are beyond all exception. <hi>Thou shalt feare the Lord thy God, and serve him, and shalt sweare by his name.</hi> It cannot there bee permissorie; it must be mandatorie. Though the tense in the originall do often but permit, not binde: as, <hi>six dayes thou shalt labour, i.</hi> thou maist: <hi>thou shalt eate of every tree, i.</hi> thou mayst: it flatly commands there. To reade, thou <hi>maist</hi> feare, or thou maist serve the Lord thy God, it were absurd. Then may not the third member be translated <hi>permissivè, Iura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis, thou maist sweare,</hi> but thou <hi>must.</hi> Tis not <hi>Libertas,</hi> but <hi>Imperium;</hi> to sweare, is not by Licence, but by Law; <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

            </p>
            <p>Wee are then yet nere the nearer. Gods <hi>Iurabis, thou shalt sweare,</hi> is not yet reconcild to Christs <hi>non jurabis, thou shalt not sweare.</hi> Surely to command and to prohibit, are <hi>opposita.</hi> If, what God doth <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, (it is <hi>Theophylacts</hi> terme) forbid what hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; Christ should crosse God indeede. But he doth not. Tis not a prohibition: tis a cohibition rather: not a simple forbidding, not to sweare; but a restraint of false and idle oathes. <hi>Sweare:</hi> God bids thee; and Christ forbids thee not, so thine oath bee not, Truthlesse or Needelesse. The Iewes, so taught by the Glosse of the Pharisees, thought it no perjurie, though their oathe were false; so they swore not by Gods selfe directly. By Heaven, Earth, or the Temple, they thought they might sweare freely, though falsely; and if falsely, much more idlely. Christ but corrects that errour. Hee will not have them sweare, not onely not by God, but not by <hi>any</hi> thing, frivolously or falsely. Christ but forbad those oathes which the Law forbad before; <hi>vaine</hi> oathes: <hi>thou shalt not take Gods name in vaine, i.</hi> lyingly, or idlely; in a false cause, or a frivolous. In a just, and in a true, thou mayst sweare, thou shalt. The Law commands it: and Christ came not, nor meant not to abrogate the Law, save onely that of ceremonies. Tis <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultum ad cautelam</hi> onely, not <hi>praeceptum, Bern. Serm. 65. in Cant. Fol. 327. E.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What? will some Separists or Anabaptists say, forbids not Christ oaths simplely? <hi>all</hi> oaths, false or true, light or serious? Hee bids, sweare not <hi>at all.</hi> What can be sayd more plainely, more perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily? <hi>Nejuretis omnino,</hi> I say, <hi>sweare not at all;</hi> that is, as they expound it, by no <hi>oath</hi> whatsoever, in no <hi>cause</hi> whatsoever. These men wrest Christs <hi>Omnino, temere, Beza</hi> saith unadvisedly, <hi>morosè, Calvin</hi> saith, perversely; straine the universall particle, to the matter of the oath, which Christ meant of the forme, as the context shewes plainly to the considerate reader. I say Christs <hi>Omnino</hi> meanes not the act of swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, but the forme of oath. As if our Saviour sayd, thou shalt not sweare falsely or rashly, <hi>at all;</hi> that is, neither by God, nor by his creatures. For to sweare by Heaven, by Earth, or by the Temple, to protest the thing avoucht to bee as verily true, as the Temple is Gods house, Heaven his Throne, the Earth his Footstoole. Which is as much though indeede indirectly, as to sweare, <hi>vivit Dominus, the Lord liveth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the thing thou swearest be false; thinke not, the forme of thine
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:173124:206"/> oath will excuse thee. Thou swearst by God <hi>implicitè,</hi> though thou name a creature. Sweare not <hi>at all so,</hi> by <hi>any</hi> thing. If the thing bee light, and in thy usuall speech; sweare not at all too: <hi>Yea</hi> will serve, and <hi>Nay.</hi> Christ will have Christians tongues so true, that they shall not neede to sweare. Their bare asseveration shall suffice. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Athan.</hi> Holy mens words, as oaths. What they shall but simply say, <hi>Iuratum puta;</hi> it shall be as sure, as if they swore. Thus is there no repugnancie betweene Christ and his Father. God saith in the Law, thou shalt sweare. But my Text tells with what cautions, <hi>in truth, in judgement, in righteousnesse.</hi> Christ saith in the Gospell, sweare <hi>not:</hi> that is, idlely; it is prophanenesse; or falsly, tis impiety. Now tis true, that Christ sayd, <hi>Ego &amp; Pater unum sumus,</hi> Christ and his Father are all one.</p>
            <p>This grand scruple thus removed, the defence of oaths will be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offence; which else would have beene odious. I know the Fathers are severe, Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> too violent: he bids a man, if hee heare one sweare, rebuke him; thats but moderate. But hee bids, beat him too; beat him in the street, <hi>etiam in foro,</hi> even in the open market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>streete: smite him, though he be injayl'd for it, though hee suffer death for it: let him sanctifie his hand, with bruising his blasphemous mouth. See that good Bishops zeale in Gods cause. But their rigorous censures rose of the enormous licentiousnesse of men, their outrage in oaths; not of the simple unlawfulnesse of the thing. That appeares by their owne practise. Some of the most peremptory would sweare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, when cause required. The abuse of swearing God abominates, Man abhorres. It is a cause, I will not advocate. Saint <hi>Chrysostomes</hi> zeale I wish in all of us, so farre as to rebuke the idle swearer, what wee may doe discreetly. For one disgracefull word, that shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne our selves, wee point the field, hazard our lives. But wee suffer God to be pulld out of heaven, Christ anew crucified, yea rent in pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with execrable oaths, and it moves us not. But not every thing, that is abused by wicked men, must therefore not bee used by sober men.</p>
            <p>To sweare simply is lawfull: not lawfull of indulgence, that we may; but of commandment, that wee must. Tis a precept here, else where; tis often, <hi>Thou shalt sweare. Thou,</hi> not Iew onely, but Christian too; <hi>every tongue, Esa.</hi> 45. Twas not well sayd of S. <hi>Hierome, Evangelica veritas non recipit Iuramentum,</hi> the Gospel doth not admit oaths. The Gospell doth. The Christian sweares sometimes, sweares lawfully, even by the Gospels. Christians not onely not forbid to sweare, to sweare at all; but they doe, and may sweare, even by Christ. Hee is not worthy the name of a Christian, that refuseth to sweare by the name of Christ, saith <hi>Bullinger.</hi> They were alwayes Schismaticks, that shunned oathes, Anabaptists among Christians, Essens among Iewes, a sect of Iewish Separatists.</p>
            <p>All Divines almost antient and moderne, hold that swearing is a part even of Gods service tis no mervell, twas commanded, not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> sayd. Gods service is not Leave, but Law. What say I, all Divines? Philosophers say, in an oath is <hi>Divina veneratio,
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:173124:206"/> Aristot.</hi> Oathes not <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, honourable things onely, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> termes them, but <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, holy things. <hi>Iuramenta</hi> be <hi>Sacramenta,</hi> I say, oathes are holy things. And therefore according to the inscription up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Aarons</hi> Mitre, <hi>Sanctitas Iehovae, Holinesse to the Lord,</hi> claimed by Gods selfe, to be made all by his name. An oath is one sort of sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Gods name; and so <hi>implicitè</hi> prescribed by Christs owne selfe, who seemd to forbid swearing: coucht under even one of the petitions of his Prayer, the very first of them. Is not invocation divine worship? And what Oath is without it? What oath of Mans? Every one hath in it (would God every one considered it) both imprecation and invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. What doe I, when I sweare, but call on God, to be either witnesse to my Truth, or revenger of my Falsehood. An Oath, an Act, though in respect of Subject, civill and humane; yet in regard of God, whom we call to witnesse, religious and divine. So farre from impiety, that I should either with the Essen, or the Anabaptist, refuse it in just cause; that when I sweare, I give God glory; the Scriptures owne phrase. <hi>Ioshua</hi> adjuring <hi>Achan,</hi> bad him, <hi>Give God Glory, i.</hi> Sweare. So did the Pharisees the blind man in the Gospell, <hi>Da Gloriam Deo.</hi> For what doe I, when I sweare, but confesse the Lord to be my God. I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge his Truth, his Iustice, his Omniscience.</p>
            <p>Haply I perswade not yet: will you see example? Law sometimes sway lesse then instance, You have the Precedents of many Prophets. <hi>Moses</hi> swore once; <hi>Ioshua 14. 5. David</hi> often, to <hi>Saul,</hi> to <hi>Ionathan.</hi> Lest you challeng them with <hi>Theophilacts</hi> exception, they liv'd under the Law: which of the Patriarkes did not sweare? <hi>Ioseph</hi> did. Or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his Oath is censured, <hi>Iacob</hi> did, his Father; <hi>Isaac</hi> did, his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father; <hi>Abraham</hi> did, the Father of all the faithfull. But you looke at the Gospell. All these were Iewes; you expect Christians. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did, an Apostle, and not once. Patriarkes, Prophets, Apostles, all sorts of Saints have sworne. Will you say, but Saints may sinne? Angels have, who cannot. Not <hi>Daniels</hi> Angell onely; least you say againe, the <hi>Law</hi> was then; but Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> Angell too, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 10. Christ did, <hi>exemplum exemplorum.</hi> Oathes are not abrogated by the Gospell. The Lord of the Gospell swore himselfe, swore often. <hi>Amen, Amen, Iuratio ejus est,</hi> saith <hi>Augustine,</hi> tis his oath. Christ did? God did: Gods selfe swore often by himselfe. His Precept here he confirmd by his owne Precedent. What he did, he did.</p>
            <p>How else shall men commerce, nay how at all converse one with an other, if we may not sweare? Oathes are the Seales and Sinnews of all common life: without which no man may dare trust another. The Witnesse will lie, the Promiser will faile, the Prince will breake his league, the Private man his covenant; the Magistrate will be unjust, and every Officer unfaithfull, <hi>Omnis homo mendax,</hi> many a man though sworne, but every man unsworne will lease and lie. Policy is Gods Ordinance. Can it administer Iustice without Oathes? Oathes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, not lawfull onely, betweene all men. Not publicke Oathes alone, as betweene Princes, or imposed by Magistrates; but private also betweene man and man, voluntary oathes: so the Swearer take them with religious heart, and in cause important. The Scripture for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:173124:207"/> them not; and we have the Precedents of many holy men, <hi>Iacob</hi> to <hi>Laban, Booz</hi> to <hi>Ruth, Obadiah</hi> to <hi>Elias.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of publicke, no man (I thinke) of judgement doubts: but Private Communication you will haply confine to <hi>yea,</hi> and <hi>nay.</hi> Looke, what exceeds <hi>that, à malo est,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>it is of evill.</hi> Nay, tis Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, Saint <hi>Iames</hi> saith tis true: but the Apostle meanes in speech of course, of idle oathes; Christ of false, and idle too. Hee takes Gods name in vaine indeed, that sweares; when he needes not. <hi>God will not hold him guiltlesse,</hi> but condemne him: both phrases of one force; S. <hi>Iames</hi> but expounds <hi>Moses,</hi> And for Christs censure, what exceeds <hi>yea,</hi> and <hi>nay, à malo est, it is of evill;</hi> tis true too: but whose evill? not <hi>Iurantis,</hi> but <hi>non Credentis,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> not thine, that swearest; but his, that forceth thee to sweare, that will not else be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve. Or will you read it, <hi>à Maligno est,</hi> tis from the evill one, that is, the devill: and then it taxeth him that sweares. For it is the devils guise, to sweare, saith <hi>Epiph.</hi> Indeed <hi>Theophylact</hi> expounds it so; and <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donat</hi> abbets him; because it is not <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, but <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and that also with an Article, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. But first, that is but a Quirke. And <hi>Epiphanius</hi> is wrong too. I thinke, no man hath found Sathan to sweare in all the Scripture. Thats an <hi>Item</hi> by the way to the idle swearer, that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits a sinne, which Sathan himselfe does not. But read it as you please, <hi>A malo,</hi> or <hi>a maligno,</hi> Let swearing be of Sathan, and the censure touch the swearer, not the urger onely: so you stretch not the reason beyond Christs intended straine, of false and idle oathes.</p>
            <p>There is a time to sweare. The Magistrate calles me; I must <hi>then.</hi> When want of other proofe, end of quarrell, my neighbours safety, mine owne fame, or Gods glory craves it: I must then. Mine oath then is not idle: I must looke, it be not false; and I trespasse not ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Christs, or the Apostles prohibition. I obey both law, and Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell. Presse not the Commandement, <hi>Thou shalt not take Gods name in vaine.</hi> I doe not. My cause is waighty. and mine Oath is true: I tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe not; I should, if I swore not. Not those places onely cited out of <hi>Deuteronomie,</hi> and my present Text, bid me sweare expressely; but even the <hi>Decalogue</hi> too, <hi>implicitè,</hi> more covertly. Divines teach in the <hi>Decalogue,</hi> that every Negative precept includes an affirmative. <hi>Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God, in vanum.</hi> Leave out that last word; and the affirmative is true: Thou shalt assume the name of God. Let his Name be, <hi>ever</hi> be in thy mouth, in Oath, out of Oath; so it be not in vaine. <hi>Clinias</hi> in Saint <hi>Basil</hi> was too superstitious; who would rather beare the fine of three talents, then hee would sweare though in a just cause.</p>
            <p>One Scruple more, ere I end this. There is a phrase or two frequent in speech, in faith, in troth, on my faith, on my troth, offensive to many, as prophane, chalengd by some, as oathes. I submit me to your censures, that can Iudge; I pray your Patience, that can not. I will condemne all oathes, as well as you, not taken in true cause, or in due time. But these termes I take not to be formes of swearing. Saint <hi>Basil</hi> notes some speeches, that have the forme of swearing, but are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed oathes. He instances in <hi>Ioseph, by the life of Pharaoh;</hi> in Saint <hi>Paul,
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:173124:207"/> by our rejoycing,</hi> both (hee saith) simple speeches, though in shape of oathes. One may bee so precise, as the <hi>Waldenses</hi> sometimes were, that verily, and truly, hee will hold for oaths. These phrases in questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are indeede more harsh then they: but I will not say, hee sweares whom I heare use them. Haply hee may; if hee thinke them to bee oaths, they are to him; as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>linguam ream non fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit nisi mens rea;</hi> else they are not. Phrases more sounding like an oath then they, are thought no oaths by men of judgement. As sure as God liveth, and such like, I finde in <hi>Eusebius,</hi> a Bishop put in his subscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In faith, in truth, and such like are not oaths, but protestations. You will say, they both are one. But they are not. Protestation is but a vehement asseveration. It may bee joynd with oath; but it selfe is none. Indeede a Canonist saith, that to say, <hi>per Deum,</hi> and <hi>per Fidem,</hi> is all one. But hee meanes by Faith, Religion. But the protestation meanes credit and fidelity, honesty, integrity. When I say, on or by my Troth, on or by my Faith: I sweare not by my Faith on Christ, or my confidence on God: but I protest onely the cause in question to be so, or not, as I am, and would bee thought honest and upright. The honorable man in some affaires, in which meaner men are sworne, gives his word onely, <hi>verbum hominis,</hi> protests but by his honour. Shall I call this an oath? That phrase and these are peeres.</p>
            <p>Now to conclude this part, a thing, the beginning good, Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, and the end good, the stinting of quarrell, the strengthning of truth, the preserving of thy selfe, and neighbour from slander or dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, the promoting of Gods glory, thinke not Christ hath forbid thee. He inhibits onely, he prohibits not: he inhibits the rash swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, he prohibits not all oaths. But thinke that sweare thou maist; God lets thee: Nay sweare thou must; God bids thee, <hi>Iurabis, thou shalt sweare.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The forme followes; you have heard the act. God bad us <hi>sweare;</hi> now he tells us how. The forme is, <hi>the Lord liveth.</hi> Thou shalt <hi>sweare</hi> saith the Lord; but thou shalt sweare <hi>by</hi> the Lord. The act enjoyned often; but the manner ever joyned withall: it must bee by his name. <hi>David</hi> swore so by the Lord. So did <hi>Ioab,</hi> so did <hi>Saul;</hi> all <hi>Israel</hi> did, till <hi>Ieroboams</hi> time: then they began to sweare by <hi>Baal.</hi> Till then, even before the Law, and all, all swore by God. Even Heathens when they urged any <hi>Israelite,</hi> any Hebrew to sweare, required it in that forme. <hi>Sweare to mee by the Lord,</hi> saith <hi>Rahab</hi> to the spies. So did the Egyptian to <hi>David,</hi> bad him sweare by God. So did <hi>Abimelec</hi> to <hi>Abram, sweare by God thou wilt not hurt-me.</hi> For to sweare by Gods name, and the Lord liveth, is all one. Gods selfe, who best knowes what him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe meanes, expounds it so, <hi>Ier.</hi> 12. 16. Yea even this very phrase was frequent too, none more, none so much in Scripture; sanctified by Gods selfe. God often swore; but mostly in this manner, <hi>vivo ego, as I live,</hi> saith God. The forme is diversified in termes; but the same sense in all: every oath both exacted and taken in Gods name. Tis Gods will, <hi>Esa.</hi> 65. Whosoever sweares, shall sweare by God. <hi>Omnis lingua, every tongue, Esa.</hi> 45. not of men onely, but of Angels too: both <hi>Daniels</hi> Angels, and Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> in the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> both swore
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:173124:208"/>
               <hi>per viventem in secula,</hi> by him that lives for ever.</p>
            <p>Sayd wee not, that to sweare by God, was a part of serving God? and observe we not the ceremony of lifting up the hand, to be a phrase in Scripture to signifie an oath; <hi>I have lifted up my hand,</hi> saith <hi>Abram</hi> to the King of <hi>Sodom,</hi> that is, I have sworne? the hand lift up to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that is, to God, whom wee call to witnesse. <hi>Iuramenta</hi> bee <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menta,</hi> an oath an office of Religion. By whom I sweare, on him I call, as my <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the knower of my heart, and so the witnesse of my truth. <hi>Solus or andus, solus jurandus.</hi> All invocation belongs alone to God; and therefore oathes are his peculiar. <hi>Summi deorum hic honor proprius,</hi> sayd <hi>Apuleius;</hi> it is an honour due unto his name, his onely: and therefore cald by <hi>Moses, Exod. 22. Iuramentum Domini,</hi> the Lords oath. Not because God sweares; and yet hee doth sometimes, oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times: but because, as <hi>Esay</hi> sayd, hee that sweares, shall sweare by God.</p>
            <p>Tis then impiety to sweare by creatures, grand sacriledge to sweare by any thing but God. Heathens may teach us that Religion: they swore by those things, which they adord for Gods. <hi>Terram, mare, si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dera juro, Latinus</hi> oath in <hi>Virgil,</hi> by earth, sea, and starres. <hi>Vesta</hi> the earth, and <hi>Amphitrite</hi> the sea, Goddesses with them. And the starres they cald all <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the Sunne and Moone, and all the hoast of heaven, were Heathens gods. Their ignorance condemnable, but their zeale pardonable. They would not, had they not held them Gods, have sworne by them. Christians oaths then by creatures, what Atheisme is that? Christians worse then Iewes, worse then Gentiles: Iewes swore by <hi>Baal;</hi> they thought him God. Did not the Priests pray to him, <hi>O Baal exaudinos?</hi> The Gentiles by <hi>Iupiter,</hi> did they not sacrifice to him? <hi>Iupiter</hi> was but a man; <hi>Baal</hi> but a beast, but the image of a beast; yet they thought them Gods. But Christians sweare by things which themselves confesse but creatures. Bread, Salt, the Essens both in <hi>Epiphanius.</hi> By the light, the <hi>Manichees</hi> oath. Papists by some things more excellent, but yet not Gods, by Saints and Angels. This is indeede, not irreligion, but tis superstition: not impious Atheisme, but grosse Idolatrie.</p>
            <p>God bids sweare, the <hi>Lord</hi> liveth, not the Angels. <hi>Moses</hi> bids sweare by God, not Saints; by Gods selfe, not by Gods Mother. The masse too is an oath, used even by Protestants. Is there not a God is <hi>Israel,</hi> but we must goe to <hi>Belzebub</hi> the God of <hi>Ekron?</hi> Must <hi>Ierusalem</hi> needs sweare by the sinne of <hi>Samaria?</hi> Let Gods people sweare by God. But by God, meane the Lord. For there are <hi>many Gods,</hi> the Apostle saith. Angels are called <hi>Elohim, i.</hi> Gods. Papists swearing by them, may say they sinne not, they are Gods too. They are indeede, but <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, vouchsaft the name by favour; but are not Gods indeede. But as the people cryed to <hi>Elias, Dominus Deus est,</hi> the Lord <hi>he</hi> is God, the Lord <hi>he</hi> is God. God prevents here that evasion, bids sweare not, God lives, <hi>but the Lord. Israel</hi> would sweare <hi>vivit Deus,</hi> and yet meane <hi>Baal, Amos 8. vivit Deus tuus, O Dan.</hi> But thou shalt sweare, <hi>vivit Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah, the Lord lives.</hi> Thats Gods proper name; <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               <pb n="381" facs="tcp:173124:208"/> saith <hi>David, Psal. 83. ult. Iehovah,</hi> Gods name onely; never was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture called by it. Thou shalt sweare, <hi>vivit Iehovah, the Lord liveth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What? will some men say, is every oath tied strictly to these termes, to these two words, <hi>vivit Iehovah, the Lord lives?</hi> Tis not my meaning, nor the Prophets. God here defines the forme of oath; but confines us not to the precise syllables. Sweare in what termes thou wilt; but sweare by him. <hi>Iacob</hi> swore by <hi>the feare of Isaac:</hi> who was that but God? Gods selfe swore by <hi>the excellencie of Iacob, Amos</hi> 8. which was Gods selfe: By his hand, by his holinesse, thats Gods selfe too. By his soule; <hi>mens cujusque est quisque;</hi> what is my soule, but my selfe? And Christs <hi>Amen,</hi> if it be <hi>Sacramentum,</hi> an oath, as Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> makes it, what meanes it, but Gods truth, which is Gods selfe? Gods attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes are Gods selfe. <hi>Abraham</hi> swore his servant by the God of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth. <hi>Paul</hi> protests by Christ, and by the holy Ghost. Yea holy men of God have sworne sometimes in other formes, but equipol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent all to this. <hi>The Lord is my witnesse,</hi> Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> oath often. <hi>I speake before God,</hi> the Apostles too. <hi>The Lord doe so, and more to me,</hi> often in Scripture. Nay Saint <hi>Paul</hi> sweares to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> by their rejoycing; <hi>Iuratio est,</hi> tis an oath, saith Saint <hi>Augustine;</hi> but it meanes Christ. Our magistrates adjure us, <hi>so God us helpe by Iesus Christ,</hi> a godly forme too. All these, and other like, sound to one sense, and are all authorised under this forme.</p>
            <p>There is an antient oath, used yet in the universities, and otherwhere; tis by the holy Gospels. This some have censurd as savouring of Rome. But both Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> and Saint <hi>Austin</hi> show it antienter then Poperie. Nor sweare wee by the leaves and letters of the booke; but either by his spirit, that endited it, or by his Sonne, that is taught in it, Christ the subject of the Gospels.</p>
            <p>Nay, an oath is not impious by creatures neither, with reference to God. Christ simply forbids not to sweare by heaven and earth. The reasons which he addes, incline to the quite contrarie. But with the Iewes conceit, that they might breake their oath, or sweare a lye, if they swore but by them onely, because they are but creatures; hee forbids us to sweare so. He sweares by God, that sweares by them. For the one is his footstoole, the other is his throne, Gods name is in his creatures. If naming them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> looke at God, I sweare by him in them, they are the mirrours, the glasses of his glory. <hi>Moses</hi> cald twice to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, heaven and earth.</p>
            <p>Object not, tis then lawfull to sweare by Saints and Angels; they are creatures too. They are. But superstition worships them as Gods; and therefore to sweare by them gives suspition of Idolatry. Else he that sweares by creatures; though indeede indirectly, yet sweares by God; though not expressely, yet by implication. As wrong, or mercy done a Prophet or Disciple, Christ reckons done to him: so an oath by a creature, with reference to God, is intended as taken even by Gods owne name. Else what shall wee judge of their oathes in the Scripture, who swore by mens soules; not <hi>vivit Dominus,</hi> the Lord lives, but <hi>vivit Pharaoh, by the life of Pharaoh, Iosephs</hi> oath. Him hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you censure; the court had corrupted him. But not hee onely; but
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:173124:209"/>
               <hi>Hannah</hi> did by <hi>Helies</hi> soule: <hi>Vrias</hi> did, <hi>Abigail</hi> did, sweare by King <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> soule. Nay <hi>David</hi> did by <hi>Ionathans</hi> soule; the <hi>Shunamite</hi> by <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shas</hi> soule; nay <hi>Elisha</hi> by <hi>Elias</hi> soule, one Prophet swore by another Prophets soule. To say, they all sinned in it, were an hastie sentence. Nor have I lighted yet on any, that censurd them. I will conster <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph candide. By Pharaohs life?</hi> whats that, but by Gods selfe? All men indeede, but Kings especially live by God. But for the rest, tis plainer; let the Hebrew phrase bee weighed; and it is not, as thy soule liveth; but by the life of thy soule. And is not God the life of soules, <hi>anima animae,</hi> the soule of soules? So that though not in terme, yet in trope they swore by God. In which sense some have sworne by baptisme, by the Sacraments. Some Germaines doe so now.</p>
            <p>To end this part, Christ bad, pray thus, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; not say this, but Pray thus, ties us not alwayes to the words, but sets a rule for Prayer. We may pray in those words; but we must pray in that wise. God bids, sweare thus, the Lord liveth; ties us not to the termes: onely our oaths must keepe that forme. The words too, if wee will, as many doe in Scripture; but the sense of force. <hi>Thou shalt sweare, the Lord liveth,</hi> that is, by the living God. Idolls are Gods; God calls them so in <hi>Ironie,</hi> but dead Gods. Wee must sweare with the Angell, by him that lives for ever. The turke though an infidell, sweares by the Immortall God. Idolls are Gods, but false Gods: <hi>Israel</hi> swore by such, by <hi>Baal,</hi> by <hi>Malcham.</hi> But he that sweares, saith <hi>Esay,</hi> shall sweare by the true God, 65. 16. God bids sweare by <hi>his</hi> name. The name of a strange God shall not be heard out of thy mouth, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. sweare not by such either Actively or passively: neither the private man sweare himselfe, nor the Magistrate sweare others by any strange God, <hi>Iesu.</hi> 23. Wee are as <hi>Darius</hi> titled <hi>Daniel,</hi> the servants of the living God: let us when we sweare, sweare by the living God.</p>
            <p>Hee that sweares by other, I will doubt hee forsweares. The oath is awelesse, that is made by creatures. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, saith the old man in <hi>Aristoph.</hi> hee but jests, that sweares by <hi>Iupiter.</hi> To sweare by any thing but God, lessens the Religion of an oath. An oath (saith <hi>Philo</hi>) is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a calling God to witnesse. People to flatter Princes, would often sweare by them, by their healths, and by their childrens: <hi>per genium Caesaris.</hi> But <hi>Polycarpus</hi> a religious Bishop, chose rather to be burned, then to sweare by <hi>Caesars</hi> Fortune.</p>
            <p>One scruple rests, which for the unlearneds sake would be remov'd, lest one Text seeme to crosse another. God, that bids <hi>Israel</hi> here, to sweare, <hi>the Lord liveth,</hi> in <hi>Osee 4. 15. forbids Iudah</hi> there to sweare, <hi>the Lord liveth.</hi> May not one oath serve both, both living under one Law, both serving under one Lord? Surely God would that <hi>Iudah</hi> should swear, as <hi>Israel should,</hi> but not as <hi>Israel did.</hi> They should swear so, but not with <hi>them.</hi> For when <hi>they</hi> swore so, they swore falsly; and when they would swear truly, they would swear by <hi>Baal.</hi> So the Rabbins say of thē upon that place, and the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphrast constens it so too, swear not the Lord lives <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in a lye. Sweare God lives▪ but <hi>sweare in truth,</hi> the next point in my Text, <hi>Thou shalt sweare, the Lord liveth in truth, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There remaine yet three Particulars. This last taught <hi>how</hi> to sweare:
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:173124:209"/> these teach <hi>How</hi> too: but this in what forme, those with what af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. Sweare; but not falsely, lightly, leudly; but <hi>in Truth, Iudgement,</hi> and <hi>Righteousnesse.</hi> Or they confine the cause in which we sweare, the object of our oath; it must be true, of waight, and honest; briefly of each.</p>
            <p>For the first; trespasse not Truth in Oath: tis Perjury. A lye is base; the charge of it, costs blood sometimes. Perjury is impious. Him that will leaze, I will not hold for honest: but not a Christian nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that will forsweare himselfe. Will a man (saith Saint <hi>August.) vel quacunque fide praeditus,</hi> of what religion, of what faith soever, Iew, Turke, or Indian, breake his Oath? An Act onely fitting him, that will say with <hi>Davids</hi> foole, <hi>there is no God. Theodorus</hi> the Atheist made it his maine argument, to perswade men to perjure. Well may he say, God is: but surely he feares him not, that will sweare by him, and lye. Thou wilt not dare call a <hi>man</hi> to witnesse a lie, for thee: and darest thou call God? That is (saith <hi>Philo</hi>) <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a most unholy, irreligious act. Sweare truely for his sake, by whom thou swearest. Tis God, whom thou <hi>dost</hi> sweare by, whom thou must sweare by. Thou makest God a lyer, if thou sweare untruth. <hi>Regulus</hi> an heathen swore, not <hi>per Christi Sacramenta,</hi> but <hi>per Daemonum inquinameata,</hi> saith Saint <hi>August.</hi> not by God, but by devils; and yet would keepe his Oath.</p>
            <p>An Oath is an honour due unto Gods name: you heard an heathen say. But he defiles it, that sweares falsely, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19. Either to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme falsehood, or to infirme truth, sweare not, tis, when tis not; or it is not, when it is. Whether thy Oath be <hi>Assertorium,</hi> or <hi>Promissori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> the Lawes distinction; be it; (I say) Assertory, sweare, as the thing is; or Promissory, sweare, as thy heart meanes. <hi>Herod</hi> would not forsweare: hee would rather doe that, which went much against his heart, even behead an holy Prophet. His act was wicked; but yet it showed his awe in Oathes.</p>
            <p>Perjury, a sinne, some have presumed, that a man will not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit; <hi>Aristotle</hi> doth. That which (as <hi>Philo</hi> termes it) is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the signe, the ensigne, the seale of Truth, to make it the cloake of false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, man hates it. <hi>God</hi> hates it <hi>Zachary</hi> saith. Gesse the sinne by the paine. The forsworne person somewhere branded, somewhere whipt. It was death with the Egyptians, Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> would have it so with Christians too. He peeres the perjured person with the parricide; and saith the magistrate ought not let him live. A sinne, which Gods selfe, as he hates it, <hi>Zach.</hi> 8. so he plagues it. Our age hath afforded us many fearefull instances. Gods curse (saith the Prophet) shall consume both sticke and stone of the house of the false swearer. For the breach of an Oath, and it both onely promissorie, and that made by others too, unto the <hi>Gibeonites;</hi> though not made by <hi>Saul,</hi> yet because broke by <hi>Saul,</hi> seaven of his Sonnes were hung up against the Sunne, seaven Kings sonnes and grandsonnes. They were but Kings Sonnes: but <hi>Zedekiah</hi> a Kings selfe, his eyes put out, and he bound in chaines, for his breach of oath to the King of <hi>Babylon.</hi> For shall he scape that broke the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant? shall he prosper, that set light the oath? saith the Lord. God will destroy (saith <hi>David</hi>) all that <hi>speakes</hi> lies. What will he doe to them, that sweare lies?</p>
            <pb n="384" facs="tcp:173124:210"/>
            <p>What then is Romes Religion, that countenanceth perjurie? does both practise it, and procter it? The Pope a Christian, more a Catholicke, yet more, Christs Vicar, who was truth it selfe, to pander perjurie, <hi>O tempora!</hi> Yet pardon him for Country too. Italy is Greece too, nay tis <hi>magna Graecia,</hi> so <hi>Plinie</hi> cals part of it. Grecians but petty liers to the Pope; he a grand Grecian, <hi>i.</hi> a great lier, a grosse forswearer. <hi>Iura, Perjura;</hi> sweare promissorily fealty to thy Soveraigne, the Pope will assoile thee: forsweare assertorily any thing to the Magistrate; the Pope will pardon thee.</p>
            <p>Nay, pardon needs not; tis no sinne. A Papists Oath made to a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant, though nere so false, yet is not Perjury: thats salved many waies. For if the Oath be assertory, the scape is easie by Equivocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: which who so useth, Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> calls him <hi>Detestandam Bellu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,</hi> a detestable beast. If it be promissory, the party is a Calvinist, or a Lutheran at least; Faith is not to be kept with heretickes.

And for Equivocation, this terme taxes all sophistrie. <hi>Fraus</hi> (saith the Heathen Oratour) <hi>distinguit, non dissolvit,</hi> fraud bindes thee faster; it easeth not thine Oath, it aggravates thy sinne.

            <p>Christ said to <hi>Martha, vnum necessarium, one thing was needfull.</hi> Tis not so here. God craves in Oathes, not truth alone, but <hi>Iudgement</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> too. Thats the next; that no man sweare, but on good ground, and in just cause, not rashly, nor idlely. For the first, the thing thou swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, must be certaine, not true onely. The oath is nought, not onely if the thing be false; but if thou <hi>doubt</hi> of it. Sweare, but deliberately. <hi>Affirme</hi> not, what thou knowest not; that were folly. But be sure thou know it, ere thou sweare. Oathes are unlawfull even in <hi>truth,</hi> unknowne. Sweare not upon thought, upon guesse only: Oathes must not be adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured. Thou swearest with bad conscience, and prophanest Gods name,
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:173124:210"/> when thou calst him to be witnesse, that the thing is true, which thou knowest not, whether it be true or false. It is not Perjurie; but tis next doore to it. Thats for the ground. And not onely in Assertorie oathes, but in Promissorie too. Sweare not there neither on uncertaintie, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse thou know, know assuredly, that both thou canst performe it by thy power, and maist by the Law, both Gods and the Kings. Now for the cause, tis true that Saint <hi>Austin</hi> saith, <hi>non peccat, qui verum jurat,</hi> he sinnes not that sweares truth. But there must be cause. To sweare of use, no cause requiring it, that is not <hi>In judicio,</hi> tis <hi>Ad Iudicium,</hi> twill bring judgement, Gods judgements on thee. The Iewes in <hi>Asaes</hi> time swore to the Lord, that they would serve him. Well might they sweare that, as they did, aloud, joyfully and heartily. <hi>Abraham</hi> swore to <hi>Abimelech,</hi> and so did <hi>Isaac,</hi> both to make a league. <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Saul,</hi> that he would not slay his seed. A man to his neighbour in suspicion of fraud; a woman to the Magistrate in suspetion of adultery. Oathes of Gods owne authorizing. Thou maist not sweare in truth, in trifles. Want of proofe, end of strife, my fame in question, my neighbours great hurt hazarded, and Gods glory above all; these are just causes, why a man should sweare; you heard before.</p>
            <p>Some sweare (great is that summe) where no cause is, where no gaine is, where no gain-sayer is, onely of bad use, to make their speech more full, more sounding. Better speake abruptly, better not speake at all. Tis somewhat which some say; they are urged to it; else they are not trusted. But why swearest thou, when thou needst not, idlely at home, to thy friends, to thy servants, <hi>Cum tibi creditur, cum nemo exigit,</hi> nay <hi>horrentibus hominibus,</hi> though thou see the hearers turne the head at it, stoppe their eares at it, bend their browes at it, yea checke thee for it? <hi>Ne assuescas,</hi> saith <hi>Ecclesiasticus, make not a custome of naming the holy one.</hi> The Prophet said, the <hi>false</hi> swearer, but the wise man, saith the idle swearer too, Gods plague shall never goe from his house, not one alone, or two; his house shall be full of plagues, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 23. 11. The world hath many evill customes; but this of swearing is <hi>mala, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la, valdè mala,</hi> saint Saint <hi>August.</hi> bad above all bads.</p>
            <p>First, Gods name which I ought to honour, I make vile. The voyce said to <hi>Peter,</hi> what God makes holy, let not man prophane. Gods name, Gods selfe calls holy; thou prophanest it. Gods fearefull name, as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> calls it, <hi>Verendum</hi> to the devills, they quake at it; <hi>reverendum</hi> to the Angells, they bow at it, thou makest contemptible. God charges <hi>Israel, Levit. 22. Not to pollute his name, in things hallowed to his name:</hi> thou dost. God hath hallowed oathes unto his honour; and by them thou makest him base.</p>
            <p>Secondly, assiduous swearing, daily, hourely use of oathes endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers perjurie. Of <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

Whereas therefore the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees taught in their Catechisme, <hi>Non pejerabis, thou shalt not sweare falsely:</hi> Christ taught in his, <hi>Non jurabis, thou shalt not sweare at all.</hi> Still except just cause. Wise and religious was the Rabbins counsell▪ <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap> set a hedge before the Law. The Law prohibits Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurie.
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:173124:211"/> Christ addes a fense. To be sure not to sweare falsely, hee bids sweare not at all. <hi>Perjurium praecipitium,</hi> Perjurie (saith Saint <hi>August.</hi>) is a pit, a deepe one, the bottome bounds on hell. Hee that sweares lightly, though truely, yet <hi>juxta est,</hi> he is neare it. He that sweares not at all, <hi>Longe est,</hi> he is farre enough from it. <hi>Falsa juratio, exitiosa; etiam vera periculosa, nulla secura,</hi> saith the same Father; false swearing is damnable; true is dangerous; none at all is sure. Still <hi>exceptis praeexceptis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, there are that hurle oath upon oath, sweare <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, every word an oath, <hi>Philoes</hi> termes too. Oathes so bitter and thicke, that (as the wise man saith) would make ones eares to tingle, and his haires to stand. Tis <hi>Theophrastus</hi> Character of a despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate man. They thinke belike, as they in the Gospell, to be heard for their many words, so these to be beleeved for their many oathes. <hi>Philo</hi> calls them fooles; seeing that <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, multitude of oathes is a signe (saith he) of falsehood, not of truth. I will beleeve him least, that shall sweare most. His many oathes come not from the truth of his heart, but from the use of his tongue: oathes are his ordinarie. Nay there is a Generation yet more wicked, that sweares (saith <hi>Theodoret</hi>) <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, make a sport of oathes. These are the right desperates. What should I say to these? <hi>Hippocrates</hi> forbids to physicke the desperate. Such would have sentence from the Iudgement seat, not from the Pulpit.</p>
            <p>To end this, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, saith <hi>Philo,</hi> oathes are no toyes, no tenise balles to tosse upon the tongue. <hi>Haud ludus, juratio, Aug.</hi> swearing is no game. An obscene word, an unchaste terme, is a great abomination in a womans mouth, saith an ancient Father. What then is a blasphemous word in a mans mouth? The blasphemous <hi>Israelite, Levi.</hi> 24. is said to have stab'd the name of God. So the word there signifies. The swearer in a manner stabbes Almighty God; and so is not <hi>Homicida</hi> a man-slaier a great crime, but <hi>Deicida,</hi> a murtherer of God, <hi>Bernard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beware of oathes, idle oathes: make not a use of them, much lesse a sport of them. There is a <hi>word,</hi> the wise man saith, <hi>is cloathed with death,</hi> this is it. Oathes are deathes cloathes. Darest thou put them on? The prophane man dares; cloathes himselfe with blasphemie, <hi>as with a robe,</hi> saith <hi>David.</hi> But what followes? <hi>It shall runne like water into his bowels, and like oyle into his bones.</hi> Sweare <hi>the Lord lives,</hi> in <hi>Truth;</hi> but sweare in <hi>Iudgement,</hi> never but in neede, in just cause of oath. <hi>Hercules</hi> an Heathen (<hi>Plutarch</hi> saith) swore but once in all his life. Sweare not thou so oft, not once, unlesse in case of necessitie. Doe as Christ bids us; here his rule is kindely, <hi>sweare not at all.</hi> Whatsoever is more than <hi>yea</hi> and <hi>nay, a malo est, it is of evill.</hi> Or if you will needs sweare; doe as a Spanish Postiller bids mothers teach their children, sweare by <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbes</hi> onely, <hi>certè, sanè, profecto, certainely,</hi> and <hi>truely.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The last thing here required is <hi>Righteousnesse,</hi> last, but not lightest, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> and belongs alone to Promissorie Oathes. God will not have thee sweare to sinne. To any Act, <hi>contra Ius, contra Fas,</hi> against Right, or Religion, binde not thy selfe; let not any binde thee. The mightiest
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:173124:211"/> Magistrate cannot command that. For Religion; Say that the Parent shall sweare the child to Popery, the Prince the subject to Idolatrie. Wilt thou sweare by God, against God? <hi>Et me mihi perfide prodis?</hi> as <hi>Mercurie</hi> said to <hi>Battus. Iuramenta</hi> be <hi>Sacrementa.</hi> Oathes are holy things. Wilt thou abuse holy things to unholy ends▪ Tis not then (saith Saint <hi>Augustine) Sacramentum,</hi> but <hi>Execramentum,</hi> not a grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but a hatefull thing to God. For Right; take not an oath against thy neighbour, to doe him dammage in body, goods, or name. An oath is <hi>Iusjurandum;</hi> either <hi>Ius,</hi> or not <hi>Iurandum.</hi> Sweare not the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of any wicked thing. For what is ill to act, is worse to sweare: because thou call'st God to be witnesse unto wickednesse. It was a leud oath, though <hi>Davids;</hi> (Saints slip sometimes) that he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy <hi>Nabal,</hi> and all his family. So was <hi>Iorams</hi> and <hi>Iezebels;</hi> his to behead <hi>Elisha,</hi> hers to slay <hi>Elias:</hi> not to persecute, but to execute Gods Prophets. The Iewes more leud, not swearing onely, but cursing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves too, to murther Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> Sweare not to doe evill. Oathes must not crosse either Pietie towards God, or Charitie towards men. Gods bids thee sweare, but <hi>in Iustitia;</hi> be sure it be <hi>in Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what if in Infirmitie or Incogitancie, in weakenesse or vnwari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse my oath be past, I have sworne already? God that bids sweare in <hi>Righteousnesse,</hi> bids sweare in <hi>Truth</hi> too. Then must I say with <hi>Iephthe, I have opened my mouth unto the Lord, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and I can not goe backe.</hi> Surely to breake an oath, is a great sinne: but to keepe it, to doe evill is a greater. Of two evills ever choose the lesse. Nay to breake a wicked oath, is not sinne neither. Tis sinne to make it, not to breake. <hi>Impia est promissio, quae scelere adimpletur, Isidor.</hi> tis a wicked oath, which mischiefe must performe. Must <hi>Herod</hi> kill a Prophet, to fulfill his oath? But <hi>Injusta vincula solvat Iustitia, August.</hi> Righteousnesse must losen, must cancell unjust bonds. Thou art sworne; and thou art bound. Tis true of oathes, which <hi>Moses</hi> said of Vowes, they are the <hi>Soules bands.</hi> Heare the Wise mans counsell, let not thy mouth cause thee to sinne. <hi>Nulla pactio,</hi> saith the Civilian; no Promise, Protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Vow, nor Oath, which projects villanie is of validitie. An oath <hi>contra bonos mores,</hi> is not <hi>obligatorium,</hi> a rule in Law too. No oathes unhonest binde the conscience. Let the Pope practise here his dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sative power. Here he hath authoritie: every Bishop hath; every Priest hath, to assoile a penitent swearer from a wicked oath.</p>
            <p>I must end; oathes are Gods homage, ordained to honour him. Turne them not against him, by swearing to serve <hi>Baal.</hi> Nor against his anointed, to shed his bloud, or alien his subjects. Sweare not any evill against any soule. Let not <hi>Sacramentum pietatis</hi> be <hi>vinculum iniquitatis,</hi> the badge of Religion, be the bond of wickednesse. Or haply hast thou sworne already? Looke at the Law, not at thy oath. Pray God to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don thee for taking it: Double not thy sinne, by fulfilling it. Bind not two sinnes together; and the latter errour too worse than the first. To double thy loade, when thou maist ease thee of the halfe of it, were great madnesse. Such an oath was <hi>Herods.</hi> Much better might he have broke his oath, then slaine a Prophet. <hi>Fidei putavit esse quod erat amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae,</hi>
               <pb n="389" facs="tcp:173124:212"/> saith Saint <hi>Ambrose:</hi> while he would prove himselfe a true man, he showed himselfe a mad man, a leud man. Saint <hi>Hieroms</hi> saying shall end all, unlawfull oathes <hi>laudabiliter solvantur damnabiliter, observan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur;</hi> tis commendation, if thou breake them; tis damnation, if thou keepe them. And thus have I shewed unto you how you must sweare; you must sweare by God in Truth, in Righteousnesse and in Iudgement, not by the Creature, Saint, or Angels for that which is false, idle, or frivolous; so shall God have the honour due unto him, and your selves the comfort of it: and that we may all so do, Thou that commandest us to sweare, give us wisdome to follow these thy directions, and that for thy deare Sonnes sake Iesus Christ our Lord, <hi>Cui, &amp;c.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a <hi>Proverbe,</hi> a lewd Proverbe, used by the wicked Iewes, upon Gods threatning them captivitie, charging him with injustice; as pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing the children for the parents sinne. The proverbe is Allegoricall: their <hi>Fathers eating sowre grapes,</hi> is their ancestours acting unkind sinnes: and the <hi>setting the Childrens teeth on edge,</hi> is Gods inflicting the paine on their posterity. <hi>Our Fathers have eaten sower grapes, and the Childrens teeth are set on edge;</hi> that is, our ancestours have sinned, and were all punished. Thus blackmouthed blasphemie barkes against hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, layes iniquitie to Gods charge.</p>
            <p>Strange that man should mutine so grossely against God. Not one man onely; (thats seene often, some impious Atheist to play the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <hi>Rabsakeh,</hi> and revile God) but a people; It is <hi>Popularis,</hi> not <hi>Singula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris sermo,</hi> not one mans speech, but a multitudes; a Proverbe, God calls it so. One among many to be taken in a sinne, in any sinne, is
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:173124:213"/> no wonder. One <hi>Zimri,</hi> a Leacher; one <hi>Achan</hi> a Theefe, in all the hoast of <hi>Israel,</hi> is not strange. Two defrauders of the Church, <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira,</hi> among thousands of beleevers, not strange neither. But a proverbe is a speech, <hi>in ore omnium.</hi> God calling this so, meanes, it was <hi>Vox populi,</hi> the mutinie of the whole people, and what people? <hi>Israel:</hi> thats in this verse too. A whole people, and that <hi>Israel,</hi> Gods people, <hi>Israel Dei</hi> (tis <hi>Pauls</hi> phrase) to put a proverbe upon God, a proverbe of impious and odious accusation: God hath reason to expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stulate, to aske <hi>what they meane by it:</hi> thats also in this verse. Not what the proverbe meanes; hee askes not that; hee knew the sense. The words, though allegoricall, are plaine enough. But what they meane to mutine, to cast such a wicked imputation upon God.</p>
            <p>The Lord is tender of his attributes, will not have his Titles toucht. Earthly Kings will not. <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Spaine</hi> will bee stiled Catholicke; <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> most Christian; King <hi>Iames</hi> most justly defendour of the Faith. Their coine may not be clipt, much lesse their stile. Gods stile is ample, hath many high and honourable attributes. Iustice is one of them. There is in Scripture, not a cloud, but a world of witnesses, to shew that. Men on earth, Prophets, Apostles; Saints in heaven, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> Christ in the Gospell. I will not cite Gods selfe, who may say, <hi>teste meipso,</hi> better then Kings may. But hee is a partie here. Heathens acknowledge it; <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did.

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> that is, justice.</p>
            <p>The judge of all the world, shall <hi>Hee</hi> be unjust? <hi>God forbid,</hi> saith old <hi>Abraham: Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Absit,</hi> too. Theres no <hi>Absit</hi> in the Scripture, no <hi>Absit</hi> in any of Gods attributes, save in this. <hi>Dementis est,</hi> to doubt of it, is madnesse, saith Saint <hi>Austin.</hi> Yet because here <hi>Israel</hi> questions the point; nay they question it not, they flatly say, God is unjust, flatly, though closely; they cover their Atheisme under an Allegory: to say it, will not serve, that God is just; tis fit we show it too. The proverbe is <hi>Israels;</hi> they were then in <hi>Palaestine.</hi> But all lands have some <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites: England</hi> hath Iewes not onely had in ages past, hath still, many Iewes. The same spirit that spake in <hi>Israelites</hi> then, speakes in many Christians now; murmurs at Gods judgements. They say, not in their hearts (that were lesse lewdnesse) thinke it onely, speake it out, <hi>Patres comederunt,</hi> charge God with injustice, for afflicting them. Heare thou Iewish Atheist, not sayd onely, but shewed thee too, that God is just. For what is justice? Is it not to give to every one his owne, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

            <p>I wrong God all this while, while I dispute for him. God is the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant: twas not my part to argue. <hi>Actori incumbit probatio. Israel</hi> is the Plaintife; he must prove. Lets heare his Arguments. What doe these Proverbers object against Gods Iustice? They cry with those Mutiners in the Prophet <hi>Malachie,</hi> where is the God of Iudgement? But whats their proofe of Gods injustice? See first their Art, to speake in Allegorie. It is odious to say bluntly, God is unjust. The Hearer haply would rend his cloathes, at such a blasphemie. Wickednesse is wily, will guild a bitter pill, cover foule meaning with faire words; mutine, but under Metaphors. Malice besides Art; they desire to have it, not the speech of a Iew, but a common saying, a Proverbe.
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:173124:214"/> Proverbes runne more roundly, if Allegoricall, then in plaine termes, will be both more affected, and more vsed. They would have Gods dishonour spread. Well leave the Forme, heare the Matter.</p>
            <p>The Fathers had sinned, but the Sonnes were censured. That (you heard before) was the Proverbes meaning; God punisheth one man for anothers sinne. This is their Argument. <hi>Ergo</hi> God is unjust. The Conclusion is supprest; it is so odious. The Reason concludes reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly well, were the Antecedent true. But it is false, a calumnious asper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, as false as Sathans selfe, who suggested it. False, first, in <hi>Thesi.</hi> God doth not censure any, that sinnes not; inflicts paine onely on De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents, punisheth no Innocent. They closely instance in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. But thats the <hi>Hypothesis;</hi> of it afterward.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Abraham</hi> cried <hi>Absit, God forbid,</hi> that God should slay the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous with the wicked. That were unjust. It is more, farre more, to slay the righteous <hi>for</hi> the wicked. Farre be the first from God, farther be this; to strike the godly sonne for the godlesse Sire, to punish inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie for Iniquitie. <hi>Homers</hi> god <hi>Iupiter,</hi> witnesse his owne daughter, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, guilty, not guilty, smites them both, one with the other. That was <hi>Abrahams Absit. Israels</hi> God doth not. And indeed common calamitie God cast sometimes on both together, godly, and ungodly; and yet is not unjust, wee shall also see that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. But to strike the godly <hi>for</hi> the ungodly; neither doth God that: the righteous for the sinner never; save once onely. Neither yet was then unjust. I respite that also. God, where hee sees the sinne, there laies the paine. <hi>Moses</hi> in his zeale and love to <hi>Israel,</hi> cried <hi>Dele me,</hi> praied God to rase him out of his booke. Would he? Nay, but (saith God) he that hath sinned, him will I rase out of it. Man is so just, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazias</hi> slew the men, that kill'd his Father: but their children he slew not, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 14. and mans law provides for it, that <hi>factum unius</hi> doe not <hi>nocere alteri,</hi> one mans fact hurt another, saith old <hi>Vlpian. Maleficia tenent authores suos, non alios,</hi> saith another. All Civilians will say, <hi>Delictum cum capite semper ambulat,</hi> every man must answer for his owne act. Heaven must not learne of earth, Iustice, God of man. Those Rules are let for men, but come from God. From him man hath his Iustice. It is one part of Gods Image, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 4. 14. If man have it; God must have more; <hi>Quod effacit telae, magis est tale;</hi> It is more exact and excellent in him; <hi>Iustitiae, Iustitia Moses</hi> his phrase. Gods Iustice is Gods selfe. It beseemes not him (himselfe thinkes it, <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. 15.) to condemne him, that deserves not. The soule that sinnes, <hi>ipsa morietur,</hi> it shall die; every man shall beare his owne burden.</p>
            <p>But what if <hi>Israel</hi> make good their Argument, instance in some act, particular act of Gods? In the young children of <hi>Iericho,</hi> in <hi>Achans</hi> sons, and daughters, in <hi>Davids</hi> Infant, and others, many others? Nay, what if they shall bring Gods owne Confession, his Profession, thats more? Thats an Objection answerlesse, above all Arguments. Saith not Gods selfe, <hi>Exod. 20. Hee will visite the sinnes of the Fathers on the children to the fourth generation?</hi> Behold, may <hi>Israel</hi> say; <hi>Marcion,</hi> and <hi>Carpocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> did say, here we have <hi>Confitentem reum. Moses</hi> saith as much, <hi>Num.</hi> 34. and <hi>Ieremie,</hi> Prophets both. But they have it here from his owne mouth.</p>

               <hi>Theodoret</hi> answers them; God who in mercy covets to save all, frayes men by menaces; but threatens more then he inflicts: menaceth the parents in that manner, that being <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, they shunne sinne, lest the paine light upon their children. But his threatnings are <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, exceede his executions; and to conster God there literally, he saith, is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, irreligious. Why? because God commandes the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, <hi>Deut. 24. 16. The children shall not die for the fathers.</hi> I doubt you doe not like this answer; heare another, a better, himselfe saith, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. But I rather thinke (saith he) that God by that threatning would show his love to men, by adding the words following, <hi>odientium me, of them that hate me.</hi> As if he said, if a father sinne, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, I will forbeare. If his child also after him; yet I will spare him too. But if the Grandchild and great Grandchild shall sinne too, shall goe on still in the wayes of their forefathers; I will forbeare no longer, but will punish them. Iust so say the Iewish writers too, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> God will expect no longer. <hi>Moses Gerundensis</hi> saith, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> all the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins meane it so. God will visite the sinnes of the Fathers on the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. But it is, if the children doe <hi>Patrissare,</hi> commit the sinnes of their fathers; not else. <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Ieremy</hi> have not that clause; but the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee</hi> paraphrast hath it in both. Not the very word there, but the same sense. The best expositours all conster Gods speech so. <hi>Israels</hi> owne Rabbins doe, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>
               <hi>if the Sonne walke in the wayes of his Father.</hi> All Scriptures of this kind must bee so construed, 1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 14. 16. God foretells <hi>Israel,</hi> of this captivitie, for the sinnes of <hi>Ierobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am;</hi> not for his personall sinnes, but for the like, done by them after him.</p>
            <p>Yea but <hi>Israel</hi> replies, the fathers sinnes are punisht in the children, though innocent; their teeth are edgd, that have not eaten grapes. <hi>Achan</hi> trespast in the excommunicate thing. His sonnes and daughters were stoned as well as he. Some Rabbins write, they were conscious to his sacriledge, accessory to his sinne. No marvaile then, their teeth were edgd, if they ate grapes too. Others of them say, they were brought with <hi>Achan</hi> to the place of execution, not <hi>ad supplicium,</hi> but <hi>ad spectaculum,</hi> onely <hi>in terrorem.</hi> For it is <hi>ver. 24. Lapidabant illum,</hi> not <hi>illos,</hi> they stoned <hi>him,</hi> not <hi>them.</hi> But there is also <hi>Illos,</hi> in the same verse, they stoned <hi>them.</hi> Yea but saith <hi>Levi ben Gerson,</hi> that meanes his cattell and his stuffe. In this uncertaintie I answer with Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin,</hi> that God might justly slay them with their Father; but not for his sin, but for their owne. Had they bin Innocent, God would have spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them, as he did in <hi>Nineveh</hi> six score thousand Infants, that knew not the right hand from the left; rather spared the fathers for their sakes, then destroyed them for their fathers. Yea God would have sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Sodom</hi> for ten righteous mens sakes. That he would not punish the just with the ungodly, you may see by <hi>Lot:</hi> though hee burnt <hi>Sodom,</hi> yet he saved him: The Angell would not, could not (tis sayd there) destroy the Citie, till <hi>Lot</hi> was out of it.</p>
            <p>How then did God in <hi>Iericho</hi> destroy all, yong as well as old? I will not take advantage at the Hebrew word; I might. It is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> thats not an Infant, or a Child. It is one yong, but of yeares of understanding,
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:173124:215"/> old enough to shake off the yoake of obedience, the word sounds so. But the Text there saith <hi>All,</hi> excepts none. And that word there by <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necdoche</hi> must reach to Infants too, though properly it meane them not. <hi>Rahab</hi> is excepted, and her kinsfolkes, and family; All else were slaine. This indeede made <hi>Marcion,</hi> and some moe Hereticks, to charge God with injustice; but unjustly. For what if there were Infants as many as in <hi>Niniveh?</hi> Infants are not <hi>All</hi> Innocents. For act, they are: but God lookes further. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, there is a serpent even in the Cockatrices Egge. God here saw malice in the seede. The children were young here, but yong <hi>Canaanites.</hi> [God saw what they would be <hi>Atas parentum pejor av<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s tulit—Nos nequiores,</hi> more wicked then their Fathers.]</p>
            <p>But <hi>Davids</hi> Infant, begotten in adultery, why did God punish it? <hi>Because</hi> (saith the Prophet) <hi>thou hast caused by this deede, Gods enemies to blaspheme; the child shall dye.</hi> Say this was no yong <hi>Canaanite.</hi> I answer. God punisht <hi>David</hi> in the child; and yet punisht him not; (for hee had pardoned him the verse before) but chastened <hi>David</hi> in the child. The childs death afflicts the Parent; but the childs selfe is happy. Death to it was no punishment; God tooke it unto him. Lord when thou pleasest, punish me so.</p>
            <p>But the poore Infant, before God takes it, suffers sometimes very greevous paines. Be death no punishment, torment is. The answer is easie, if not baptized. Sinne, though but originall, deserves Gods wrath. If christened: God sends <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t not those peines to punish it; but that he may give it the more glory in his kingdome. This haply sounds hash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that God should paine it here, to crowne there. Pardon me, I say it not in Popish sense, as if the paine merited the Crowne. But the young Babe hath taken the Sacrament of Baptisme, as Gods presse mony, and the signe of the Crosse, as the Colours of Christ. Hee must fight, though nere so young. Not with the world, or Sathan; hee wants yeares: but with the Flesh, as hee is able. With the Flesh, not temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him, (tis too early) but tormenting him. Who is crowned, that strives not first? Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith. This little Souldier does, as hee is able; and his Captaine crownes him for his paines, I meane, after his paines. <hi>Israels</hi> instances are answered.</p>
            <p>Theres one excells all these, all other. I sayd God never stroke the just for the ungodly, save once onely. Who was that? Was it <hi>Moses?</hi> For the <hi>Psalme</hi> saith, <hi>Israel</hi> so angred God, that hee punished <hi>Moses</hi> for their sakes. Tis not hee. God punisht him by <hi>Israels</hi> occasion, but for his owne sinne; his incredulity. Tis sayd there, hee spake unadvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly with his lippes. But tis Christ: Him onely God punisht, <hi>Iustum pro Injustis,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> the Iust for the Vnjust: and yet was not unjust. Because though the sinnes were ours, for which he suffered, yet he tooke them upon him Nor did his father put him to death for them: <hi>Mortuus est, quia voluit,</hi> saith the Prophet, his sufferings were all vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunary.</p>
            <p>Apply the proverbe now to <hi>Israels</hi> selfe. You see tis false <hi>in Thesi:</hi> prove it <hi>in Hypothesi.</hi> Their teeth are edgd, they say; but their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers atethe grapes. Their Fathers sinned, and they are punisht. See
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:173124:215"/> first their hastinesse; they are not punisht yet. The Prophets had told the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, they should goe into <hi>Babylon.</hi> They are yet in <hi>Israel,</hi> every man under his Fig Tree, and his Vine. What if God did but threaten them, as hee did <hi>Niniveh? Ezechiel</hi> had cryed at the 12. Chapter, yee shall goe into captivity. So <hi>Ionas</hi> cryed, <hi>Niniveh shall be destroyed;</hi> did more, added the time, <hi>yet forty dayes.</hi> Yet it was not destroyed Who could tell whether God upon their repentance, would have spared them too, and have adjournd his judgements to the next generation? Say, God would punish <hi>Israel,</hi> as hee did; yet not in their dayes haply. God had sayd as much, had threatned the captivitie 200. yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in <hi>Ieroboams</hi> raigne. Why complaine they without hurt? their teeth are not edgd yet, they belie God.</p>
            <p>Secondly see their hypocrisie; their Fathers have eaten the sowre grapes; they have not, they are innocent. Like the Harlot in the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs,</hi> who eates and wipes her mouth, and saith, shee hath done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. So have these Proverbers eaten some grapes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oo. Theres one ver. 30. Idolatrie; as sowre a grape, as ever their Fathers ate. Nay sowrer then their Fathers. They were Idolaters; but worshipt <hi>Baal</hi> onely. These worshipt all the hoast of heaven, the Gods of all the nations, <hi>Moloch,</hi> and <hi>Ashtaroth, Succoth benoth</hi> and <hi>Ashimah, Nergal</hi> and <hi>Adram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melech,</hi> grapes which their fathers never tasted. One sowrer yet, <hi>ver.</hi> 31. they made their sonnes and daughters passe thorough the fire. No mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile if their teeth were edgd. God, if he punish them, is not therefore unjust. For the holy Ghost saith, 1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 17. they had hardned their neckes, like unto their Fathers.</p>
            <p>Say these complainers had beene all righteous men: must God needs be unjust, Because he brings them into <hi>Babylon?</hi> Are temporall evills all for sinne? They art not, God oft intends them for some other ends. That the man in the Gospel was borne blinde, Christ saith, twas not for sinne, his parents, or his owne; but for Gods glory; that a work of wonder might be wrought on him, to show Christ to be God. The Martyr dies, not for his sinne, though sinne be worthy death; but to seale the truth of the Gospel with his blood. <hi>Iob</hi> was a just man, the none-such of the world, by Gods owne testimonie, <hi>Iob</hi> 1. 8. God stroke him strangely; made him a none-such too for misery. Not for triall onely of his Faith, and Patience; but to give the world a proofe, what man can suffer, supported with Gods grace. God let <hi>Ioseph</hi> be sold, a bond-slave into <hi>Egypt,</hi> a harmelesse child. Twas not for sin: but to feede his Father in the yeares of famine. This Prophet, and <hi>Ieremie,</hi> both went into captivitie, not for their sinnes, but for Gods service; to be Gods Preachers to Gods people there. So was <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,</hi> and his fellowes carried away too, bound into <hi>Babylon;</hi> nay worse, cast unto Lyons, and the hot fierie furnace; but to doe God speciall service there.</p>
            <p>One scruple more, and I end. The Iewes complaint here hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny lyes; but one truth. The Fathers had eaten sowre grapes. So they had. Why were not their teeth set on edge? Is not God unjust in that? First I may say truly, their teeth were edged too. Say they were not. That was Gods patience; <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, hee bore with their
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:173124:216"/> ill manners. But their teeth were edged too. Will their children say they were not, because they went not (as they did) into <hi>Babylon?</hi> Is there no paine but captivitie? Surely God censurd their sinnes many wayes. Sword, famine, tribute to heathen Princes, are these no pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments? They felt these. Say they did not. Theres a <hi>Gehenna,</hi> a Hell after this life. The sinner, that scapes here, suffers there. Thats worse then captivitie, then Lyons, or hottest furnace in <hi>Babylon.</hi> Their Rabbins say, no man scapes both <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in this world, and <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in the world to come too.</p>
            <p>Secondly I say, Gods justice, as it is perfit, so it is free. That if hee please, he may either punish a sinner under his desert, or absolutely pardon him. Kings doe that by prerogative, and are not therefore cald unjust. For God is not an obliged Iudge. Such a one is bound to the letter of the Law. God is <hi>Agens liberrimum,</hi> free in all things. We are not to measure Gods justice by mans rules. Vnto him, perfitly just, perfitly good, just in his greatest mercy, good in his hottest wrath, &amp;c.</p>

But Prophecies are burthens, you have it often in the Prophets, <hi>the burthen of the Lord, the burthen of the Lord.</hi> He might <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, Preach, but not Prophecy: <hi>Prophecy not.</hi> He had denounc'd already many grievous plagues, inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, desolation, famine, and sword. Every day he prophecyed, hee added to the burthen, which now was growne so great, that the Priest had told the King, <hi>ver. 10. that the land could not beare it:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was now high time to inhibite him; prophecy no more. Or if all Gods judgements were not yet proclaimd, but there remained more; yet Prophets are cald droppers, <hi>v.</hi> 16. And Gods word in Scripture resembled to the raine. And therefore this dropper must not powre out his prophecy all in one place, but as <hi>Esay</hi> speaketh in an other case, <hi>here a little, and there a little. Bethel</hi> had her burthen; <hi>prophecy no more at Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel.</hi> And why not at <hi>Bethel? for it is the Kings Chapell,</hi> they will not beleeve him; <hi>and it is the Kings Court,</hi> they will not attend him. Shall truth not be credited? not in the land of lies. Is it not a worne proverbe, <hi>major pars vincit meliorem. Bethel</hi> was <hi>Baals</hi> Sanctuary; the Kings had consecrated that Chapell to idolatry: and were not <hi>Baals</hi> prophets foure hundred and fifty? how should one <hi>Amos</hi> be heard against so many? Prophecy he might, but profit he could not; for <hi>it was the Kings Chapell.</hi> Nay, prophecy he might not; neither credence, nor audience was to be had there; for it was the Kings house. The Princes palace is no preaching place. It was <hi>Iulians</hi> speech, the Emperour. <hi>Quis ferat Caesarem in templa ventitantem?</hi> Should Kings come to Church, and <hi>Caesar</hi> be seene at Sermons? Prease not to preach at <hi>Bethel,</hi> for <hi>it is the Kings Court.</hi> This is the briefe paraphrase of the parts of my Text, and the points contained therein. For the ampler prosecution of every one apart, as the time shall let, that it will please the Lord to joyne to your honourable patience, his favourable assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,

            <p>The two maine members of the little body of my Text, are, the one an Inhibition of Gods prophet; the other, an exhibition of mans rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. The inhibition containes the Action, and the Place; <hi>Prophecy</hi> the Action, <hi>Bethel</hi> the Place; I will dispatch them first.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prophecy no more.</hi> Prophecy is Gods embassie: shall not he have au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> That which was falsely said of <hi>Herod,</hi> I may truely say of it, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               <hi>the voyce of God and not of man.</hi> And is Gods voice so vile, that man<note place="margin">α.</note> shall not vouchsafe it audience. The Prophet is Gods trumpet. <hi>Clem.</hi>

               <hi>Alex.</hi> Shall man forbid his sound? Gods mouth Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> cals him; Shall man presume to silence God? Christs lips Saint <hi>Basil</hi> cals him; and shall the Sonnes of men cope the Sonne of God? His speech the Spirits breathing; and shall mans breath stoppe Gods breath? God bids him <hi>crie, Clama ne cesses:</hi> shall man bid him peace, whom God bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, crie.</p>
            <p>What though Gods judgements be the matter of the prophecy? and the Prophets words be all in Woes? Haply Gods drift is but to drive thee to repentance, and his threatnings are conditionall. You know what <hi>Ionas</hi> cryed to <hi>Nineveh.</hi> Prohibite not the Prophet, but doe as they did. The project of Gods prophecy is haply thy health; and thy conversion may prevent thy subversion. Yea what though his wil be not onely to chide, but also to chasten thee? Yet double not thy sinne, by silencing his servants. It is his mercy to premonish thee. Thy meeke prostration of thy soule will at the least allay the fury of his wrath. The <hi>Herault</hi> of defiance sent from King to King, is there ever offer to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine his speech? What is the Prophet, but Gods <hi>Herault?</hi> He hath his message of Commission. Let him speake, and spare not: tie not his tongue, so long as he speakes, but what the Spirit warrants him. Else be it <hi>Amasias</hi> or <hi>Ieroboams</hi> selfe, I a poore follower of a Country flocke, as <hi>Amos</hi> was, am too meane to censure such. But <hi>Gamaliel</hi> a great <hi>Rabbi,</hi> and a Counsellour of State, hee tels their fault, <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 39. it is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

Nay, I will say more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this loose-lipt nation mutter in their mutinies, that all the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers here are conspired to smooth the King, to fawne, and to flatter, and to supparasite the King; a King is supreame in his realmes, but under God. And if the Prophet that shall come from God, and utter nothing but the Word of God, shall be prohibited by the Prince; this is a <hi>Sauls</hi> sinne, censured by <hi>Samuel, 1 Sam.</hi> 15. Nay the sinne is worse
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:173124:218"/> then <hi>Sauls.</hi> For <hi>Sauls</hi> trespasse was but disobedience; but this is flat resistance, What God commands, he countermands.

            <p>But there is Prophecy, improperly so cald. For without wit, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out art, without reading, without judgement, boldly and blindly, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny false prophets, blunder out at all adventures, not the sound wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Gods Word, but the fond follies of their braines, things they understand not; sometime schisme, sometimes errour, rather divina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then divinity; <hi>non considerantes, sed sortientes, quid loquantur,</hi> as the Oratour speakes, not of knowledge, but by guesse, not <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, not the truth of Scripture, but their owne conjecture. Haply they hit some truth sometimes; for who (saith the Oratour) that darts all day, doth not sometime hit the white, but as blind men catch Hares, not by cunning, but by chance. <hi>Docent antequam discunt, Hier.</hi> They will prease up into <hi>Pauls</hi> chaire, that never sat at <hi>Gamaliels</hi> feet. Such spenders upon no stocke, teachers of others, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving never learned themselves, blinde leaders of the blinde, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop in restraining them, prohibites not prophecy; it is fantasie, not prophesie, and <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, <hi>Basil.</hi> every dreame is not divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p>An other kind of prophecy, cald also so improperly, is that of <hi>Baals</hi> Priests, 1 <hi>King. 18. 28. Prophetaverunt, i. insaniverunt,</hi> saith the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphrast, not prophesie, but frensie. Would God our Church could say, it had none such, who transported with a spirit of fanaticall fury, like the ancient heathen prophets, in the discrasie of their braines, breake forth into outrage. Their tongues enflamed as by the fire of zeale, not kindled at Gods Altar, but as Saint <hi>Iames</hi> saith, from hell, set all the realme on fire. And as the nature of flame is to flie up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, so this furious fiery prophecy, this sulfurious fiery prophecy comes up even to the Crowne, by combustion to consume both Scepter and Mitre, both the Princes of the Priests, the Fathers of the Church, and the Princes of the People, the Peeres of the land, yea <hi>Caesars</hi> selfe, and all. You will confesse, tis fit, such Prophets be prohibited. Say not that I slander them; for as they write, they speake, and they print, but what they preach; their bookes are <hi>mille testes,</hi> and their letters are to show of their desperate deseignes for the planting of their Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline. The Bishop that inhibites such, prohibits not prophecy; it is not <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, not prophecy, but frensie. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> could answer <hi>Festus,</hi> when he charged him with madnesse, that he spake the words of truth and sobriety. But the doctrine of these Prophets was neither true nor sober, but factious and false; which they forcing with such fury. <hi>Festus</hi> might truely tell them, <hi>Insanis Paule,</hi> Certainely sirs, ye are besides yourselves. The prohibiting of such hath warrant by Gods precedent, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. He opened <hi>Balaams</hi> asses mouth, to forbid the prophets madnesse. All the things are here together; a prophet,
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:173124:218"/> but a mad Prophet: is forbid, that is, prohibited. This shall suffice to have spoken of the action, <hi>Prophesie no more;</hi> I come unto the place.</p>
            <p>Prophesie no more at <hi>Bethel. Amasias</hi> doth not offer to silence <hi>Amos</hi> utterly, but his prohibition is provinciall. He will not have him Preach within his jurisdiction; <hi>Preach not at Bethel.</hi> In <hi>Iudah,</hi> which was out of his Precinct, he might Prophesie his fill; in the verse before my Text, <hi>Videns, vade in Iuda, &amp; propheta ibi, goe get thee unto Iudah, and play the Prophet there. Videns vade; thou Seer, goe thy wayes;</hi> had his Dialect beene Latine, his words had beene strange; as if <hi>videns</hi> were derived not <hi>á vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendo,</hi> but <hi>a vadendo.</hi> Shall <hi>Ionas</hi> flie to <hi>Tharsis,</hi> when God bids him goe to <hi>Niniveh?</hi> Shall <hi>Amos</hi> flie to <hi>Iudah,</hi> when God sends him into <hi>Israel?</hi> It is the Prophets dutie not onely to take his Theme from God, and when God bids him crie, to aske with <hi>Esay, What shall we crie?</hi> but to take his <hi>quo,</hi> as well as his <hi>quid,</hi> and to say to God, as the people did to <hi>Ioshua, quocunque miseris, ibimus, whether soever thou sendest us, thither will we goe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lord had bidden <hi>Amos</hi> to Prophesie to <hi>Israel, vers. 15. Samaria</hi> was the Center-city of that Realme, and might seeme the fittest for the Prophets purpose, to <hi>Israel</hi> in the midst of <hi>Israel.</hi> But <hi>Bethel</hi> was <hi>Baals</hi> brothelhouse, whether all the people went a whoring after him. There God was most dishonoured; and therefore it was fittest to denounce Gods Iudgements there. Say <hi>Bethel</hi> were <hi>Beth-el,</hi> that is, <hi>the house of God;</hi> for so <hi>Iacob</hi> first, Christned it. Yet <hi>Iudgement must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin at the house of God.</hi> But <hi>Bethel</hi> was <hi>Bethaven</hi> so <hi>Hoseah</hi> calleth it, <hi>the house of wickednesse,</hi> a city of sinne; and therefore it was meet, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet should Preach there.</p>
            <p>To whom should the Physitian goe, but to the sicke? <hi>Bethel</hi> was now become of Gods house, <hi>Baals</hi> house, a schismaticall synagogue of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition, and idolatrie; where Kine were killed to be offered to a Calfe; where men did bow to <hi>Baalim,</hi> the Image of God, to the image of a beast. Is sinne the soules sicknesse, and <hi>Bethel</hi> so pained with it? Are the Prophets Gods Physitians? And yet shall <hi>Amasias</hi> say unto <hi>Amos,</hi> Prophesie not at <hi>Bethel? Bethel</hi> an apprehender of Prophets, lay hold on him, saith <hi>Ieroboam;</hi> a seducer of Prophets; for there was hee beguilde, that cried against the Altar; <hi>Bethel</hi> a mocker of Prophets, the boyes cried Baldhead to <hi>Eliseus;</hi> a prohibitor of Prophets, the Priest saith here to <hi>Amos,</hi> Preach no more at <hi>Bethel.</hi> And why not at <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel?</hi> The reason is rendered in the remnant of my Text; <hi>For it is the Kings Chapell, and it is the Kings Court.</hi> I will speake of each severally.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Baal</hi> had two Temples, one at <hi>Dan,</hi> the other here. But <hi>Bethel</hi> was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the holier; hither came the King. This was a right <hi>Basilica,</hi> the Kings<note place="margin">

               </note> owne Oratorie, and the place where he presented his personall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and devotion unto <hi>Baal.</hi> Now then it was not either safe or seeme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for <hi>Amos</hi> to Prophesie against the King, before the King. Not seeme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; the censuring of the Prince in the hearing of the people, would be thought to be unseasonable, <hi>Saul</hi> thought he acknowledged hee was worthy of reproofe, yet entreated <hi>Samuel</hi> to honour him before them.
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:173124:219"/> Not safe: <hi>Scribere in eum, qui potest proscribere,</hi> to presume to censure him, who can take thy head from thee?</p>
            <p>Kings must not be used boisterously; but as <hi>Cyrus</hi> mother said, <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis byssinis,</hi> with words of silke, meekely and mildely. Prophets are rough tongued, and respect no persons: their rude iusticitie regards no roialtie. Either with basenesse they must heare them, or with danger they must silence them. They may not with their honour be censured for their sinne, and they may not with their safetie be avenged on their boldnesse, because they come from God. <hi>Amazias</hi> had complaind of <hi>Amos</hi> to the King, accused him of high treason, and used all his Oratory to perswade him unto punishment. But <hi>Ieroboam</hi> knew, hee was a man of God, who chargeth even Kings not to touch his anointed, nor to doe his Prophets harme. An other <hi>Ieroboam</hi> had stretcht forth his hand to lay hold on a Prophet, but could not draw it backe againe. Hee had heard of him. <hi>Ahab</hi> had imprisoned <hi>Michaiah;</hi> but the Lord reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his wrong. His sonne <hi>Iehoram</hi> would have beheaded <hi>Elisha;</hi> hee was wounded by the <hi>Aramites,</hi> and slaine by <hi>Iehu.</hi> Never any thrived, that dealt hardly with Gods Prophets. Predecessours precedents made <hi>Ieroboam</hi> wise. Not all the Priests perswasions could prevaile with him, once to touch <hi>Amos.</hi> And therefore he is faine fairely to entreat him to depart <hi>Bethel,</hi> and to prophesie no more. Hee threatens not, hee rates him not, but gently requests him to forbeare that place, as if hee were solicitous of the Prophets safetie, endangered by preaching in the Presence of a King, that would not be controll'd. It is the Kings Chapell.</p>
            <p>What? Is it dangerous to Preach in Palaces, to prophecie to Kings? May not <hi>Ieremie</hi> preach judgement, but he must kisse the stockes? May not <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> chide the King, but the Queene will have his head? All Kings are not <hi>Iehojakims;</hi> all Princes are not <hi>Herods.</hi> But what became of them? Was not the one smitten by Gods Angell, and the other bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with the buriall of an Asse? <hi>Pharaoh</hi> that threatned <hi>Moses, Ahab</hi> that hated <hi>Michaih, Ioas</hi> that stoned <hi>Zacharie,</hi> and <hi>Iehojakim</hi> that slew <hi>Vrias</hi> with the sword, was not God avenged on them? Did ever any prosper that did disgrace a Prophet? But Christian Kings weare crosses in their Crownes, the Cognisance of Christ; in signe of subjection unto his Scepter. His Scepter is his Word, and the Prophets are his mouth. <hi>Qui vos audit, me audit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bethel</hi> is indeede Gods Chapell, not the Kings: for <hi>Bethel</hi> is Gods house; Gods selfe so calls it by his Prophet, <hi>My house.</hi> And <hi>Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie is Gods voyce.</hi> Shall God be tongue-tied in his owne House. But say, it were the Kings Capell; thats no prejudice to Gods prerogative. In phrase it is the Kings, either as founding it, or frequenting it; but in use it is the Lords; and the house is hallowed unto his service. Some have translated it, it is the Kings Sanctuarie; not a sanctuary of refuge, to secure him from Gods censure, but the holy place, where he must heare Gods Prophets. Now the Prophet is Gods man, the Scripture termes him so; and his masters message, be it what it will, hee must deliver it. The Counsellour for the State, and the Physitian for the body, shall the King heare them, and not the Prophet for the soule? I maintaine not
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:173124:219"/> the sowre spirits of some waiward Prophets, who like the Cynicks are all in censure, and all their prophecie is onely reproofe. Their too much morositie is a scandall unto many.</p>
            <p>Much lesse allow I those, who wound the head to tickle the taile; who vainely, but dangerously affect applause of multitude by censuring the Magistrate, and seeke to please the people by perstringing of the Prince. I am not acquainted with the manners of the Court. But I know that in the Countrie, if one pragmaticall Prophet shall use pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuously to preach against the Prelacie, who are the Princes of the Priests, the people round about will flocke unto him, and those not the dregges of them, but even they also, that ride on horses, and are drawne with wheeles. And I have heard say, I hope it is not so, that upon the heare say of some audacious Preacher appointed to this place, many of the city, but I hope the lees alone, doe preasse into this presence, if haply some censure may passe upon the Soveraigne, the Prince of the people. The humourers of such hearers it is meet they be prohibited. For this is indeede, as <hi>Amazias</hi> said to <hi>Amos,</hi> not prophecie, but conspiracie.</p>
            <p>What? Will you say unto me, play you <hi>praevaricator?</hi> Betray you the authority, which God doth give the Prophets? God forbid. <hi>Plato</hi> is my friend, and so is <hi>Socrates,</hi> but the truth is more. I will not (as Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> saith) <hi>favere majestati magis quàm veritati,</hi> be a servant unto <hi>Caesar,</hi> and a traitour to the truth. <hi>Caesars</hi> be sinners as well as meaner men, yea many times greater without Gods speciall grace. Courts have few monitours to remember them. The Lord hath therefore laid this province on the Prophet. Kings soules are precious unto God, farre above their subjects. God hath therefore given the Prophets spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall charge of them. Where prophecie failes, there the people perish, saith <hi>Salomon?</hi> Nay, where prophecie failes, there Kings doe perish. I come unto the other Reason, <hi>It is the Kings Court.</hi>

The Gallants love their ease, their pleasures, and their sports. The one thinke Policie fitter than Divinitie to support the Crowne. The other doubt Religion will bring the King to melancholy; that the Prince by prophecie will grow to be precise. Courtiers are curious, and <hi>Amos</hi> was unlearned; their delicate eares would not endure his Dialect. And preaching judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment too, they would abhor him more. Their use is to applaud (<hi>Vt Aug. lib. 2. cap. 28. de civit.

            <p>These are the addle arguments of this subtill Arch-priest, pretending a care of the prophets saftie, but indeed tendering his owne particular. For if <hi>Baal</hi> were put downe by <hi>Amos</hi> prophesying; then he, and all his <hi>Chemarims</hi> were instantly to lose haply their lives, but certainely their livings.

In confidence whereof I the simplest of Gods Seers might humbly crave patience to proceede further, but that I love not to cloy my auditors, nor make my discourse seeme more tedious than profitable.

               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>HRIST in arming his Disciples to the bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of his Crosse, useth in it a crosse argument, that he that with losse of his life shall have borne it, shall gaine by his losse but he, that in love of his life, shall avoyd it, shall lose by his gaine. Art thou content to lose thy life for Christ? thou losest it not; thou dost but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change it: Christ will give thee a better, an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall for a temporall. Thats just as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Mori mihi lucrum,</hi> thy death is thine advantage. But art thou loath to lose it? Choosest rather to enjoy the good things of this life, wealth, honour, or what else, wherewith the world will wooe thee, to winne thee from the Crosse? <hi>Thou foole, this night</hi> perchance, one night, one day, at length, <hi>they shall take thy soule from thee.</hi> Who they? the evill Angels, and shall carry it to hell. Now cast thy count in time; waigh thy gaine and losse together, gaine of the world, losse of thy soule: tell me, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>; <hi>What is a man advantaged, to winne the whole world, and to lose his owne soule?</hi> This is the context. I pray you, mark

               </gap>, gaine, winning, and losse. These three distinguish the members of my Text, and be the bounders of my Sermon. Art would, I should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> at the middes of my Text, speake first of <hi>winning,</hi> then of <hi>losing,</hi>

But our life is a game; <hi>vita nostra lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, sapient.</hi> 15. 12. The gamesters, man and Sathan; <hi>impar congressus:</hi> the Players so mismatcht, that the game is as good, as lost at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Man stakes his soule, Sathan the world Or rather Sathan drawes the world; tis his stocke, not his stake; he is not so rash, to hazard all at once: some little part of it. Man is desperate, hee ventures his whole stock at once; I meane his soule. Sathan cares little to lose many games. If hee winne one in a thousand, twill suffice. If man lose but one; his soule is Sathans. For the devill will be sure, that the soule be still at stake: he will not let him draw that backe, and set some of that he wonne from him: but ever cries, as the King of <hi>Sodom</hi> did to <hi>Abram, da mihi Animas,</hi> set me the soule: he will onely cast at it. Man though nere so fortunate, must lose at length: who ever played, that never lost? If he doe; <hi>Actum est;</hi> the Devill hath that he would: hee will play no more. <hi>Ilicet, peristi;</hi> thou maist be gone too; for thy soule is gone. Then let man weigh his winnings with his losse. They are but the things of the world, which he hath wonne; say he hath wonne a world of them. Tis his soule which hee hath lost. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, but the dreame of a shadow. And what gainst thou by that, to lose a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, such a substance as mans soule, for a shadow? Nay for lesse, for the dreame onely of a shadow? I will say with Saint <hi>Augustine,
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:173124:221"/> Pereat mundi lucrum, ne fiat animae damnum,</hi> I will not winne the world, to lose my soule.</p>
            <p>Will a man exchange life for any thing? One haply will hazzard it, the thiefe will; will adventure for advantage; he hopes to scape, else he would not; will not lose it desperately for any gaine. Sathan though a lyar, sayd that truly, <hi>A man will give all that he hath for his life;</hi> But he will not give his life, for all that that the world hath. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, &amp;c. <hi>Achilles</hi> prised his life above all the wealth of <hi>Troy.</hi> The soule excells the life. I will lose my life, to save my soule. One soule worth many lives: so pretious, that being lost could not be redeemed, but by Christs death, mans soule by Gods death. Compare the world but with thy body; let Sathan touch but it, as he did <hi>Iobs.</hi> Be sicke of some disease both incurable and unsufferable. Let then bee brought to thee, millions of gold, gorgious apparrell, choise of daintie meates, all sorts of delights, that art can show, or heart can wish. Let <hi>Haman</hi> mount thee on the Kings owne horse, put his Ring on thy hand, and his Crowne on thy head. Nay, bee thou crowned a King; sit on a Throne; be the knees of Princes bended before thee. What good will all this doe thee? the Physitian gives thee over, and thy paines are tormenting. The soule excels the body, as the Gold doth Lead, as heaven doth earth. Thy soule to sicken; to sicken? nay to dye; the world with all his glory what will it profit thee?</p>
            <p>Many things cald pretious in Scripture, wine, gemmes, vessels, appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, gold ointment, and some moe. The soule cald so above them all. <hi>Solomon</hi> cals it so, the harlot hunts (saith he) <hi>pretiosam animam,</hi> a mans pretious soule. Say it meane there the life onely, not the soule. Say it be not cald so; yet it is so; is so, above all things cald so, saving <hi>Christs blood</hi> onely, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Peter</hi> calls it pretious; it excells the soule: all soules set to it, are vile: for they are mans; but it was Gods. But saving it onely, the soule transcends all things in worth, all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things. Lose it who will, wilfully; hee shall finde Christs saying true, next to my Text, that theres no <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, no ransome to redeeme it. Thousands of Rammes, ten thousands of rivers of Oyle will not ransome a soule. My first borne will not satisfie for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sinne of my soule.</p>

<pb n="408" facs="tcp:173124:222"/> terme, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> hath it there too, not losse onely, but drosse; worse, dung, filthie excrement. Askt <hi>Iudas</hi> of the ointment, <hi>ad quid perditio haec? what needed that wast?</hi> I may better, much better aske of the soule, <hi>ut quid perditio haec,</hi> what needeth this wast for the winning of the world so worthlesse, so bootelesse, a man to lose his soule, <hi>what doth it advantage him?</hi> Enough of this terme. Heare the next, <hi>to winne the whole world, winning</hi> is next.</p>
            <p>Who would not play to winne? to winne a world? might he be sure <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of it? But heres an <hi>If;</hi> tis but supposed, <hi>If a man winne the world.</hi> Well yet suppose it, that one winnes the world. The world is Gods; hee made it: and all the good things of it, are Gods too. Riches and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour are in his hand, saith <hi>Solomon.</hi> All usefull and delightfull things are in Gods gift, <hi>Bona</hi> be <hi>Dei Dona, August.</hi> Many just men have them of him, all <hi>gratis,</hi> frankly of his love, without hazard of their soules. Tis but for honour, wealth, or power, that men make all these stirres on earth, would (could they) pull God out of heaven. All these, good men, fearers of God, have fairely come by, by Gods blessing. <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Ioseph, David, Iob,</hi> infinite moe had them, and yet their soules safe too. But Sathan usurpes on Gods prerogative, makes himselfe <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the Prince of the world, gives all the things in it, pretends to give them; and God suffers him. And the worldling is his homager, sues to him for them, rather then to God. But hee must compound with him. Sathan is the grand Simoniack of the world: it must cost you your soule, if you will have ought of him. Hee sells all; but for soules one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. But we are swerved from our first allegory. Returne wee unto it; If he <hi>winne</hi> saith our Saviour, the metaphor is from play.</p>
            <p>Sathan thirsts for a soule, showes things, will lure any mans lusts. You heard them named, riches, honour, authority. Doe but play with him, and draw thy soule; he will set thee what thou wilt: any of the three, all three rather then faile. And hee will haply let thee winne a while, winne many games. Else none would play with him. [And yet sometimes he will have a mans soule at the very first stake: one shall lose it, and have wonne nothing. Many a Felon is taken at his first at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, takes a purse onely, holds it not, breakes a house onely, robbes it not, mans law laies hold on his life, Gods on his soule.] But tis for Sathans gaine to lose: and he does lightly, loses of purpose, long to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, both to allure moe gamesters, and to lay surer hold on them. Hee stakes all gold, and his gold is good, like the gold of <hi>Havilah,</hi> both <hi>speciosum &amp; pretiosum,</hi> faire and fine. For wealth, honour, and power are Gods creatures, and soe good; well worth the winning were not the losse at length so desperate. Weigh we them apart.</p>
            <p>All men crave not all three: be wealth the first, <hi>most</hi> men crave it. All spirits aspire not; nor doth every man covet Authority. But ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are witches, that inchant all men. Grace and good manners make a man, twas said of old. Thats but in writing schooles, for copies onely. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

I wonder not.

That it was not much, appeares by Christs <hi>Ironie</hi> in <hi>Zachary, a goodly price, at which they va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued me.

            <p>Honour is next; some humour rather lusts for it.

Sathan sets this too; lesse of it, or more according to his edge, that plaies. Both it, and power, (Authority) shall come to stake at once; such the man may be. They are neere of kinne; we will couple them, for shortnesse. Say there any an <hi>Alexander;</hi> craves the whole world. Thats a stake indeed worth great adventure, fits <hi>Philips</hi> sonne onely.

               <hi>Winning</hi> was a pleasing word, and the world had many goodly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> things. But <hi>Losing</hi> is unlovely, especially of the <hi>Soule,</hi> the richest thing, man hath. Surely a man may, must sometimes <hi>Sumptum facere, ut quaerat lucrum,</hi> spend to gaine, lose to winne: though it be with an <hi>if</hi> too, as tis here, on meere adventure. The Husbandman, the Trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, the Merchant man does, every man does. But here the losse ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds the gaine. I venture to lose more then I can winne. I winne the World, but lose my Soule. Sathan plaies with me as with a Child;

               </gap>; as many a gamester having lost, will say, he hath saved himselfe. And tis well, if he can say it; if having lost his money, by swearing and cursing, he have not lost himselfe too. But hee that plaies with Sathan, because he stakes his Soule, if at all he lose, his losse is even of his owne selfe; because <hi>Anima cujusque est quisque,</hi> a mans soule is a mans selfe.

As <hi>Origen</hi> saith, some sinnes are <hi>ad Damnum,</hi> but not <hi>ad Mortem,</hi> are losse, but not of life (how soundly, that I examine not) but here the losse is death. Play with the Devill; lose, and thou diest for it. Thou livest to the world, but art dead to God. For his grace is gone, which is thy Soules life, <hi>anima animae, August.</hi> thy soules soule, and many (saith that Father) <hi>in vivis corporibus animas portant mortuas,</hi> have dead soules in living bodies.</p>
            <p>Tis the Soule, Sathan seekes the <hi>Soules</hi> blood, he thirsts, <hi>Bernard. David</hi> calles him a hunter; Saint <hi>Chrysostom</hi> a fouler; Saint <hi>Peter</hi> a devourer, all of <hi>Soules.</hi> The devill worse then death: death preyes but on the Body, Sathan on the Soule. Is not his Name <hi>Abaddon,</hi> thats destruction? <hi>alias Apollyon,</hi> thats destruction too: the one is <hi>Hebrew,</hi> the other <hi>Greeke,</hi> to warne Iew, Grecian, all men to shunne to play with him.

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is the Souldiers Question at Saint <hi>Iohn Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists</hi> Sermon. Hee had terrified the people with the danger of damnation, unlesse they brought forth workes worthy of Repentance. Affrighted with his doctrine they cry, <hi>Quid faciemus, What shall we doe?</hi> He sets them cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine works of mercy, common to all men. The Publicans rest not so; but come unto him seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, and aske, what <hi>they</hi> shauld doe. Hee answers them. That see the souldiers, and come too, asking the same question, <hi>Et quid nos faciemus, and what shall we doe?</hi> This is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text; the Text needs no Division.</p>
            <p>[<hi>And</hi>] is but a Particle, a little word; we seldome daine to write it full. But—<hi>Inest sua gratia parvis;</hi> tis one of the least of the thousands of mans speech: yet out of it doth come matter worthy our marking. <hi>Bonum</hi> [is] <hi>diffusivum sui,</hi> Goodnesse doth not grudge that many should take part of it, joyes many should enjoy it. <hi>Andrew</hi> comming to Christ, calls <hi>Simon</hi> after him. <hi>Philip</hi> being called, bids <hi>Nathaneel</hi> come, and see. So doth the woman of <hi>Samaria;</hi> her selfe seeing Christ a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:173124:225"/> calls multitudes of men to see him too. The Publicans here hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>Iohn</hi> give a lesson to the people, <hi>they desire</hi> the like. The Souldiers hearing <hi>them, they</hi> request one too. Vertue provokes to Imitation, <hi>all</hi> vertue; Religion specially. See I my brethren goe up to seeke the Lord? I will say, as they doe in the Prophet, <hi>Vadam ego quoque, I will goe also. Abel</hi> saw <hi>Cain</hi> offer; <hi>Ipse quoque obtulit.</hi> He would offer too. To the wise men, that came to worship Christ, <hi>Herod</hi> would seeme as religious, as they. Bring me word, saith he, that I also may worship him.</p>
            <p>Looke at the good examples of thy brethren; and remember, what Christ said to the Lawyer, <hi>Vade, &amp; fac tu similiter, Goe, and doe thou likewise.</hi> When God speakes to thee by the Preacher; say not as the Elders said to <hi>Iudas, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, What is that to us?</hi> Hee speakes to all at once. Himselfe saith it, <hi>Quod dico vobis, dico omnibus;</hi> the Spirit speakes indifferently to <hi>all.</hi> Especially in the Doctrine of Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, without which is no salvation, thou that hast a soule to save, as well as others, must have an eare too, to heare as well as others; and a tongue, as well as they, to aske, <hi>Et quid faciemus,</hi> and what shall I do? Else wherefore art thou come? Is it onely to heare others taught? Or to learne thy selfe too? Gods feare, and to keepe his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the Preacher saith, <hi>Hoc est, omnis homo,</hi> it concernes every man. Hath <hi>Isaac</hi> but one Blessing? And hath <hi>Iacob</hi> gotten that? <hi>Esau</hi> will not rest so; but will crie, <hi>Mihi quoque, Blesse me also, O my Father.</hi> Hath the Preacher but one lesson? And hath he taught my brother that? I will not leave him so; but will crie, <hi>Mihi quoque;</hi> I also am a hearer; Say somewhat unto <hi>me.</hi> My brother hath his lesson: <hi>Et quid ego faciam? And what, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thou wilt follow others in vanitie and sinne; and thinkest thy selfe safe, if thou canst but cite example. Wilt thou fall with them? And wilt thou not rise with them? Let me say to thee, as Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> said to <hi>Theodosius,</hi> excusing his sinne by <hi>Davids</hi> example, <hi>Qui sequutus es errantem, sequere poenitentem,</hi> as thou hast sinned with them, so also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent with them. You will haply thinke, I stay too long on so light a particle: Goe we one. <hi>What shall wee doe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is well, when the guiltie heart of the hearer despaires not for his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> sinne but enquires after remedy. When feeling his sinne at the voyce of the Preacher to be unsupportable, sinkes not in his soule under the burden; but seekes to be eased of it.</p>
            <p>It is well, when sinners will endure the censure, meekely submit to the Preachers admonition. Hinder not as well the Spirit of God from speaking to the heart, as the voyce of man speakes to the eare: the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner will <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

Well if he scape so, be but onely under locke and key; have not Irons on him too: Saint <hi>Peter</hi> had, haply scourged too; Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was.

<pb n="415" facs="tcp:173124:225"/> and murtherers of Christ? Saint <hi>Stephen</hi> dies for it. Great is Gods grace in the Hearers here, to beare the boisterous termes of this rough Prophet. What an odious appellation is the bloud of Vipers! What a fearefull commination is hewing downe and burning! And that in the Publicans, professed Extortioners, and Souldiers commonly hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted men!

            </p>
            <p>Gods Word workes diversely. As the Sunne melts the Waxe, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens the Clay; so doth it the Hearers hearts, obdurates some, but sof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens others. Where God is pleased to give it edge; it cuts. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calls it a <hi>Sword:</hi> where God gives it a point, it pierces. <hi>Solomon</hi> calls it a <hi>Naile:</hi> the words of the wise masters of the Assemblies, like <hi>Goades, Salomons</hi> terme too: they pricke the hearts.

            <p>To end this, the <hi>Quid</hi> here is not generall: tis not askt in grosse, <hi>What shall we doe?</hi> For Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> had told them that before; had bid them bring forth fruits worthy of amendment of life. But the <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, the <hi>Quid</hi> is <hi>hoc aliquid. Repent, and bring forth fruites,</hi> are precepts, but confuse. The Prophet must expresse himselfe. Both Publicans and Souldiers, and the people too, by their <hi>Quid faciemus,</hi> meane that the <hi>Baptist</hi> should speake more particularly.</p>
            <p>Most tongues but ours suppresse the first and second Person, saving for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
               <hi>Emphasis,</hi> and for Distinction. When they are in the English onely, and not in the Originall, then the learned Preacher will not lightly presse them. Here tis exprest. The selfe same question was <hi>verse 10, What shall wee doe?</hi> The person is not there. Tis but, <hi>Quid faciemus,</hi> there is no (<hi>Nos</hi>) there: because the people aske there in generall; it is the Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the confuse multitude. But when the Publicans aske it by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. and the souldiers by themselves, here in my Text: tis then exprest, exprest in both: and what is exprest by the Evangelist, would be prest also by the Preacher. And tis well worthy, <hi>Repent</hi> saith
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:173124:226"/> the <hi>Baptist? for the kingdome of God is at hand?</hi> Souldiers be solicitous of Gods kingdome? whose whole worke is to fight to maintaine mens kingdomes? Martiall men hearken to a Prophet? <hi>Tempora mutantur:</hi> twas not so in <hi>Iehues</hi> time. His fellow-Captaines sayd of the Prophet, <hi>wherefore came that mad fellow?</hi> Men meerely used to feates of the war, here to inquire after duties of the Law! <hi>Silent leges inter arma, Caesars</hi> law is not heard there: tis mervaile Gods Law should be listened to by <hi>them. Nulla fides, pietasque, Lucan</hi> saith; theres neither Faith, nor Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion among Souldiers. I neede not goe so farre, as to Poets to paint them. Our Prophet here sets forth their fashions, in this very verse. For showing here what they should not doe, he tells us, what they use to doe. They doe <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, offer violence to their friends, pill and rob them of their goods, and they doe <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, of whom they can get nought by force, they complaine them to the Magistrate, as privie ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the enemie, and under pretence of short pay, extort to feede their lusts. Souldiers have moe faults: but my Text implies no more, and therefore I name them not. These to pray the Prophet to teach them, <hi>what to doe,</hi> is worthy observation.</p>
            <p>Tis much that Publicans, a greedy griping sort of men, would aske the question. would not aske rather, what shall we Have? then what shall we Doe? That they askt him not for Poll-mony, as they did Christ. But more, much more that Souldiers, military men, lawlesse lightly, and licentious, desperate men, would heare a Prophet preach of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance; and not say to him, as the <hi>Danites</hi> did to <hi>Micah, Peace, let not thy voyce be heard amongst us, lest some angry fellowes runne upon thee, and thou dye:</hi> but humbly aske him, <hi>Et quid nos faciemus, and what shall we doe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Surely a Souldier, as he is a Souldier, is no great professour of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Saint <hi>Austin</hi> calls him <hi>Impium militem,</hi> an impious, irreligious man, yet is not warre a barre to grace. <hi>David</hi> is cald a man of warre; and yet a man after Gods heart. As there are <hi>Bella Domini,</hi> some warres cald the Lords: so are there Souldiers some, that are his too. There is <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 7. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a Souldier that feared God. <hi>Cornelius</hi> a a Captaine at the second verse, a devout man, and a fearer of God too. A man may feare God; and yet build no Churches. But in the seventh of this Gospell verse 5. thers a Centurion built a Synagogue; a man of such faith, that Christ protests, hee had not found the like in <hi>Israel.</hi> What these Souldiers were before Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> Sermon, it skills not. Having here heard him, they repent. Grace working in their hearts purpose of amendment, opens their mouth to aske the Prophet, <hi>Quid faciemus,</hi> what shall we doe? The Gospel is Gods summons of <hi>All</hi> men to repentance. Yea the law, and it both: the one cries <hi>convertimini,</hi> the other <hi>resipiscite</hi> to all that will be saved. <hi>Returne yee every one,</hi> saith the Prophet, <hi>Ier.</hi> 18. 11.

            <p>It is not safe, it is not seemely, the Preachertaxe the sinner perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally. Yet tis the hearers duty, what the Preacher speakes in generall, to apply unto himselfe particularly. The Preacher is no <hi>Nathan,</hi> to tell <hi>David, Tu fecisti;</hi> in censuring sinners to single out some one. Thats
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:173124:227"/> the hearers office, every one to lay the censure to himselfe: every one to say, <hi>I</hi> am the man; what shall <hi>I</hi> doe? <hi>Peter</hi> askt Christ of <hi>Iohn; hic autem quid, what shall this man doe? Master, bid my brother, Luc. 12. 13. Martha</hi> prayes Christ, to bid her <hi>Sister, Chap.</hi> 10. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> bids, <hi>attende tibi, see unto thy selfe.</hi> What thy brothers duty, what his <hi>faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endum</hi> is, what is that to thee? Aske thou, <hi>Et quid ego?</hi> What shall <hi>I</hi> doe?</p>
            <p>Every man hath a <hi>quid,</hi> an <hi>aliquid faciendum,</hi> something which hee ought to doe; an <hi>aliquid fugiendum</hi> too, which he ought <hi>not</hi> to doe Here are of both kindes. <hi>Concussio, &amp; sycophantia,</hi> violence, and sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cophancie, that they must shunne.

But what <hi>I,</hi> what <hi>thou,</hi> what every severall man must doe in particular; that <hi>I,</hi> that <hi>thou,</hi> that every severall man must aske of the Prophet. <hi>Resipiscere,</hi> to repent, thats too generall a charg: all sorts must call for their severalls by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves out of that lumpe. It is bread, but in the loafe, a great unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die loafe. The people must call, and the Preacher must cut every man his piece of it. Tis Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> owne metaphor, to <hi>divide the word of God;</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that measure of bread that is befitting him. My Text tells covertly, <hi>&amp; quid nos faciemus,</hi> what wee, that are the Ministers, ought to doe also.</p>
            <p>This is no place to apply this Scripture to. I would not, saw I not Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> doe it first. Beloved brethren, say not you with the elders, whats this to us? wee are no Souldiers. Hee saith you are; <hi>Omnis homo,</hi> even every man, wee all doe <hi>Militare,</hi> though not <hi>secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo,</hi> yet <hi>Domino,</hi> we are not secular, but spirituall Souldiers <hi>All. Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia est vita hominis, Iob</hi> saith, <hi>Mans life is here a warfare.</hi> Christs Church on earth is calld the <hi>Militant Church, i.</hi> the warfaring Church. <hi>Paul</hi> calls us Souldiers too, not Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> onely. Where then is your <hi>&amp; quid nos?</hi> No one promiscuous generall crie, but each sort by themselves, <hi>&amp; quid nos faciemus, &amp; what shall we doe?</hi> The Magistrates, what shall wee? the Ministers, what shall wee? Gentlemen, <hi>&amp; quid nos?</hi> Artificers, Women, Servants, what shall wee? Your tongues are silent, but your eyes aske the question, fixt on the Preachers face. Then must I aske, <hi>&amp; quid ego?</hi> what shall <hi>I</hi> doe? or rather, what shall <hi>I</hi> say? I must not answer you in <hi>Ieremies</hi> generalitie, <hi>Returne you every one from your evill wayes:</hi> thats not enough. I must exhort you severally. Magistrates in <hi>Moses</hi> words, <hi>exequere justum juste, execute justice, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect no persons, take no gifts.</hi> Ministers, disgrace not your brethren, and give no scandal by your lives Gentlemen <hi>Alia, Vina, Venus;</hi> take oaths in too, leave them: they fit not Christians. Tradesmen use no deceit. Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, paint not your faces, pouder not your haires. Neither beseeme the wise, the chast, nor the religious. Servants, you may I speake to,
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:173124:227"/> just in Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> words; be contented with your wages, I rather say shunne drunkennesse, corrupt not others, nor bee corrupted by them.</p>
            <p>Come we now to <hi>Faciemus,</hi> the last word, what shall wee <hi>doe?</hi> The <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> doctrine of Faith calls for <hi>Credere,</hi> bids beleeve: but repentance craves a <hi>Facere;</hi> it stands on workes. The Law cries, <hi>Fac hoc;</hi> but not the Law alone: the Gospel cries it too. Christ as well as <hi>Moses</hi> exhorts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to obedience. The fierce menaces of the Law, and the sweet promises of the Gospell, both call for righteousnesse and holinesse of life. Cursed is he that abids not in all the things of the Law, <hi>ut faciat ea,</hi> to <hi>doe</hi> them, saith <hi>Moses,</hi> and <hi>beati eritis, si feceritis,</hi> Christ calls you blessed, if you <hi>doe</hi> them.</p>
            <p>Saith Christ, the way to heaven is narrow; few doe finde it? the gate straight, few doe enter it? Surely if Faith be it, faith onely: the way is broad enough, the gate wide enough. Nere let his Disciples say, who shall then be saved? If that suffice, which Christ sayd to the Ruler, <hi>Crede modò,</hi> doe but <hi>beleeve onely:</hi> who shall then not be saved? Then <hi>Origen</hi> was right, that not the damned onely, but the Devils too shall all be saved. For Saint <hi>Iames</hi> saith, <hi>etiam daemones,</hi> the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills beleeve also. Indeede he addes, they tremble too, <hi>credunt &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremiscunt, they beleeve,</hi> but <hi>quake</hi> withall. They doe so; but belike they neede not. Christ saith, saith often, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

Some doe; shunning <hi>Romes Charibdis,</hi> runne upon the Rockes, the <hi>Scylla</hi> of the libertines; hold them <hi>pernitiosa,</hi> pernitious to salvation; deny the decalogue to concerne Christians. Even <hi>Luther</hi> in his heate, and <hi>Melanthon</hi> though somewhat more temperate then hee, yet both in their zeale have spoken offensively: that the doctrine of workes is the doctrine of Devills; that even the Morall Law is not the word of God: speeches that have hardned the hearts of the adversarie. <hi>Hosmai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> a Papist saith they had not stood so stiffely against justification by faith onely, but for some mens too much disgracing of workes, <hi>in ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicio super articulo 4.

What Preacher but presseth them unto the people?</p>
            <p>Tis then an idle cavill, nay a false calumniation, our doctrine of sole Faith, Papists to call licentious. Surely twere so indeede, if wee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded workes out of our conversation. But wee doe not. What wee write, and preach of them, our Books and Churches testifie. How in our lives wee practise them, wee will not glory, like our adversaries.
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:173124:228"/> Farre short indeede of that we ought: we are <hi>Adams</hi> sonnes all; eate too much of the Tree in the middes of the Garden.

            <p>We persecute. Surely we doe many things wee should not: but yet we do not that. Do not they?

Noe man needs send his sonne over the sea: the Pope will send Schoolemasters over unto us. Did we well, we would make them keepe their Schoole somewhere else.</p>
            <p>What more? we are Incontinent. A Calvinist chast, is <hi>Monstrum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auditum</hi> saith <hi>Maldonate,</hi> a Iesuit, rarer then any Monster.

For a true Israelite is also a true Christian. What Christ commends in him, ought to be in us. The Definition is our Admonition: needefull, if ever, in these times; in which every man shewes, and many a man saith, <hi>Qui nescit dissimulare, nescit vivere.</hi> [It was all the Latine, that a <hi>French</hi> King taught his sonne.] Man cannot live, but by Dissimulation.

There is an Eare <hi>Ecce,</hi> and an Eye <hi>Ecce</hi> too. It is mostly in Scripture to the Eare, to hearke: but it is sometime to the Eye, to looke. <hi>Behold I bring him forth to you.

But <hi>Behold a true Israelite:</hi> a sight so rare, that (I will not say, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith of heavens joyes, <hi>Oculus non vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,</hi> no eye hath ever seene one) but a man may looke in a whole city, nay God may looke in a whole countrie, and he shall not find fiftie, fortie, thirtie, twenty, no not tenne, in all <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha.</hi> Nay in <hi>Noahs</hi> time, not eight in a whole world. Hee saved eight indeed in the Arke; but <hi>Cham</hi> was one of them, a Reprobate.</p>
            <p>Tis none of Saint <hi>Lukes Ecces: Ecce Discipulus, behold a Disciple.</hi> Christ had a whole dozen, a dozen domesticalls; sixe dozen at large, all of his owne calling and ordination: besides voluntaries infinite; for so the Pharisees said, <hi>Totus mundus sequitur eum,</hi> a world of men fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him, some <hi>ad discendum,</hi> some <hi>ad vescendum.</hi> Not his <hi>Ecce Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prosus, Behold a Leper;</hi> Christ said, <hi>There were many Lepers in Israel.</hi> Not <hi>Ecce defunctus, behold a Corpse, Luke</hi> 7. Corpses are ordinary. What needs an <hi>Ecce</hi> in ordinary things? Not <hi>Ecce potator, behold a drinker,</hi> as the Iewes cried of Christ. That needs no <hi>Ecce</hi> neither; every towne, every street is full of such. The signes before the doores, what are they else but <hi>Ecces? Ecce hîc, ecce illic;</hi> the Magistrate there may see them every day. But it is, <hi>Behold an Israelite, behold a true Israelite.</hi> An Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelite, a bare Israelite, and say no more, is no rare sight.

But <hi>a true Israelite</hi> is <hi>as the shaking of an Olive tree, and as the grapes, when the vintage is ended,</hi> as saith the Prophet, that is, but here and there one.</p>

               </gap>, an <hi>Israclite,</hi> not that is cald so but that is so. Nay, not that is so neither, thats not enough. All <hi>Iacobs</hi> posterity were Israelites <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,</hi> but <hi>meri,</hi> not <hi>veri,</hi> meerely so, not truely so; of <hi>Israels</hi> flesh, but not of <hi>Israels</hi> spirit. It is a question, whether <hi>Anima</hi> be <hi>ex traduce,</hi> whether the Soule come from the Seed, spring fro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the Parents. But out of question, <hi>virtus non traducitur,</hi> Faith, Piety, Integrity, are not from mans seed. All Israels issue have Israels blood in them, and so are all Israelites; but they have not all his grace in them; and tis it, makes a right Israelite. <hi>Iacob</hi> was <hi>Homo planus, (Moses</hi> cals him so) a plaine dealing man, without Covin, without guile. Looke who was of his line, and endued with this vertue, he is a true Israelite. Tis such an one, Christ bere defines; where shall we find such an one?</p>
            <p>If I aske Saint <hi>Chrysostoms</hi> question (<hi>Orat. in hypanten</hi>) where is an Israelite? you may answer me, as he doth <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, you have <hi>Peter, Paul,</hi> and <hi>Iohn.</hi> You have 3000. <hi>Act.</hi> 2. You have 5000. <hi>Act.</hi> 4. But if I say, <hi>Cedo verum,</hi> give me a true Israelite: tell me not of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands, <hi>Iohn, Paul,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> I admit. But for those thousands, <hi>Peter</hi> is said to have converted them, and they to have beleeved. But that they all persisted, the Scripture saith not that. <hi>Hyminaeus</hi> and <hi>Phyletus, Demas,</hi> and <hi>Alexander, Phigellus,</hi> and <hi>Hermogenes,</hi> we read of their beleefe and their conversion. But we also read, that they revolted. Haply they were Israelites; but there was guile in them.</p>
            <p>If you seeke a bare Israelite, every nation hath an <hi>Ecce. Italy, Spaine, Germany,</hi> can show you shoales of them. <hi>France</hi> could sometimes, and so could we; but a false and subtill people. The Scribes and Pharisees were Israelites all, but guilefull all; Israelites but Hypocrites. It is the stile which Christ bestowes on them, seaven times in one Chapter, <hi>Scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites. Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira</hi> were Israelites both, but conspirers in guile, beguilers of God. <hi>Ioab</hi> an <hi>Israelite,</hi> but a false dissembler, <hi>Art thou in health, my Brother?</hi> So he said to <hi>Amasa,</hi> While with the one hand he tooke him by the chinne, with the other he thrust him into the belly. <hi>Elymas</hi> the Sorcerer was an Israelite, a Iew; but full of all subtilty. <hi>Lopez</hi> the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> that would have poisoned Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> was he not a Iew? Nay <hi>Iacobs</hi> owne Sonnes (and who can be righter Israelites, then they, then <hi>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s.</p>
            <p>To the Iewes, that boasted, they were <hi>Abrahams</hi> Sonnes, Christ answered that they were, and yet that they were not. They were of
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:173124:230"/> his Linage, but not of his Beleefe. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith the same, that faith makes men the Sonnes of <hi>Abraham.</hi> His <hi>Creed,</hi> not his seed makes the right Sonnes of <hi>Abraham.</hi> Saint <hi>Peter</hi> saith as much, women are <hi>Sarahs</hi> daughters, while <hi>they doe well.</hi> So it is here. <hi>They are not all Israel, that are of Israel. He is not a Iew, that is one outward, but that is one within.</hi> He is a Gentile, though he be a Iew, that breakes the Law; and he is a Iew, though he be a Gentile, that obeyes the Law. Christ meanes an Israelite, not <hi>Gente,</hi> but <hi>Mente, Augustine,</hi> not by propagation, but by imitation; not Israels Sonnes, but rather his Disciples. Or say, his Sonnes; for the <hi>Syriacke</hi> hath it so: yet his Sonnes, as his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. For Disciples are one sort of Sonnes. Not <hi>ex Sanguinibus, ut ver.</hi> 13. but <hi>ex Moribus,</hi> not by being of his blood, but by following of his vertues.</p>
            <p>But why a true <hi>Israelite?</hi> why should not a man, in whom there is no guile, be rather named from <hi>Noah,</hi> from <hi>Abraham,</hi> from <hi>Lot,</hi> from <hi>Moses, David, Ioshua,</hi> all just and holy men? <hi>Iacob,</hi> a supplanter from his Mothers wombe, a secret fugitive, a leaser, a defrauder, a catcher of advantages, cited by our Saviour for a sample of sincerity? Decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved he not his Vncle, his Brother, his owne Father? Say not, I cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure him too severely. Even his owne Father censured him, <hi>venit in dolo,</hi> he came fraudulently. Is this the plaine man, <hi>Moses</hi> meant? who twise lyed to <hi>Isaac,</hi> twice beguild <hi>Esau,</hi> [yea strove for precedency, even at the wombes mouth?] a Supplanter by name, and so upbraided by his brother, that he <hi>justly</hi> was cald <hi>Iacob▪</hi> charged with theft by <hi>Labans</hi> Sonnes; nay chalenged by <hi>Labans</hi> selfe. One may thinke, our Saviour should have rather said, behold a right Israelite, in whom there is no truth. It seemes, that definition would have much more fitly, though not sorted with the Sample, yet suted with the Subject.</p>
            <p>Most of these Imputations are but meere Calumniations. But his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guising with his Father, to get his Brothers blessing, by a lie, I will not justifie, qualifie I may. Some writers maintaine it, but by Equivocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; a sorry fig▪ leafe to defend a lie; and a shift fitter for a false Iesuit. His Mothers importunity, and his right to the blessing by his Brothers sale, may quit him of malice, but not cleare him of untruth. But how is <hi>Iacob</hi> then a Paterne of Integrity, a precise Precedent of honest sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity? All lies are guile. If <hi>Iacob</hi> were a leaser, how is an Israelite, a man void of guile.</p>
            <p>Surely the Fathers were jealous of the honour of the holy Patriarkes; some of them immoderately. For were they not men? might they not sinne? Did not Saint <hi>Peters</hi> selfe, whom Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> instanced for a true <hi>Israelite,</hi> deny his Master, and that with oath and imprecation? Or say, that was not of guile, but of infirmity. Doth not Saint <hi>Paul</hi> charge him with dissimulation? I trow▪ that was guile. But neither was <hi>Iacob</hi> a Patriarke then, when he trespast in that kind: It was in his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority. Nor was he Israel yet: twas twenty yeares before he had that name. And Christ here in my Text takes the Subject of his rule, sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>names his guilelesse man, not of <hi>Iacob,</hi> but of <hi>Israel.</hi> Say, there was guile in <hi>Iacob:</hi> in <hi>Israel</hi> there was none. With change of Name, God changed his heart. As the Scripture saith of <hi>Saul, mutatus est in virum
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:173124:230"/> alium, he was then turned into an other man.</hi> Search all his Story, see if in all his life he used guile, after he was <hi>Israel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not to be long in this, our Saviour in saying, <hi>Behold a true Israelite,</hi> implies, there are some false. All good things have their counterfeits, false Prophets, false Apostles, false Christs, false Gods. There are false Israelites: moe false then true. That it sufficed not Christ to say, <hi>Behold an Israelite;</hi> but he is faine to adde a terme of difference, behold a <hi>true</hi> Israelite. That is the thing defined, now to the Definition. You saw the Instance; heare the Rule. <hi>In whom there is no guile.</hi> Tis short &amp; plaine.</p>
            <p>It was a rare testimonie, Christ gave <hi>Nathanael,</hi> to be <hi>a true Israelite,</hi> rare but darke. Here he explaines it, <hi>One in whom there is no guile:</hi> Twas well, Christ spake among plaine men. Had the Scribes heard him, and the Pharisees, had some heads heard him of these times; they would have said, Christ purposed to define a foole. Who is not now a foole, that is not false? Of little understanding and small wit, that is not of great subtiltie, and much wilinesse? Plainenesse is weakenesse, and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lide sinceritie, stolide simplicitie. No man is honest, but for want of wit. Conscience comes onely from a craz'd braine. Not to be a wilie Foxe, is to be a seely Asse. He hath no reach, that doth not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reach. Onely to disguise is to be wise; and hee is the profoundest, that is the grandest counterfeit. Christ will have coupled a Serpent and a Dove together, Wisedome and Simplicitie. And hee bids, what God hath joyned, man should not sever. But the world dares uncouple them. Vncouple them? Thats little, dares divorce them. Doves may not sort with Serpents, singlenesse and sapience harbour in one heart. Certainely plaine dealing is a Iewell: but the world will dubbe him a sot, that useth it.</p>
            <p>Hence it is, that now adayes men dare not deale uprightly, lest their wit be call'd in question; are afraid of honest plainenesse, lest they be held for Idiots. The secular Priest though a false teacher too, yet is gibed at by the Iesuite, as a semi-sot; because he is not full so false as he. Terme one an honest man; you doe discredit him. The name of foole is so disgracefull; one will rather be a villaine, than be called a foole. But here Gods Word, Gods Wisedome, defines a true Israelite, that is, a right honest and religious man, by truth and plainenesse, <hi>he</hi> is one, <hi>that hath no guile. David</hi> calls liars and deceivers, <hi>Fooles, Psal.</hi> 5. 5. The <hi>upright walker,</hi> the <hi>just worker,</hi> and the <hi>true speaker,</hi> he <hi>lodges in Gods house, Psal</hi> 15. The <hi>deceitfull person</hi> may not dwell in <hi>Davids</hi> Court, the <hi>teller of lies</hi> may not come in <hi>his</hi> sight, <hi>Psal,</hi> 101. And all Kings are of <hi>Davids</hi> minde. Though the Tragicke say, <hi>Haud intrat unquam regium, limen fides</hi> (he is a true Courtier, in whom there is no truth) Truth sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome treads over the Kings threshold: yet Kings would wish their Courts were quit of guile. Yea the whole kingdomes, and the heads of the wisest (when they make their lawes) straine their utmost wits to prevent all guile among their people. Yea coven and deceit, though practised by all men, yet is hatefull to all men: though they stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious of it; yet it odious to them. Summon an assembly of all the falsest wretches in a Realme, to speake even from their conscience their conceit of guile; they will confesse, just as Christ saith here, that hee is
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:173124:231"/>
               <hi>a true Israelite,</hi> a right righteous man, that hath no guile. Tis not the voyce of God, and not of man: but <hi>Vox Populi, vox Dei,</hi> all the world saith it in heart, as well as Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pilat</hi> askt Christ, <hi>What thing is truth?</hi> Here would be askt, what thing is <hi>Guile?</hi> And yet what should I aske, that which every man knowes, knowes experimentally. Yet because some men maintaine, that which God condemnes, let us aske, what is guile? <hi>Cum aliud agitur, aliud fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitur, Aug.</hi> When to doe hurt I pretend one thing, and intend an other. When I doe <hi>ridere &amp; mordere,</hi> with a cringe and conge stabbe a man to death; so <hi>Ioab did.</hi> When I kisse, whom I betray; so <hi>Iudas</hi> did. When my tongue speakes, what my heart meanes not. When I show that without, which I know is not within. Aske againe for example, what thing is guile? Not to define it, but to instance it. Fraud, Leasing, Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie, Calumniation, Prevarication, Sophistication, Equivocation, all Falsification; these things are guile. None of these beseeme, none of these are in a true <hi>Israelite. Platoes</hi> lawes censure guile <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, whether in Act, or Word; Heathens <hi>honestum</hi> goes so farre. <hi>Gods Law craves truth</hi> even <hi>in the inward parts, David</hi> saith. There is a guile in spirit, he saith that too. Neither must that be in a true Israelite. Hand guile, Lippe guile, Heart guile (and what guile is not one of these?) Of all these he must be cleare. These are the Heads of guile; and every Head hath many members. Hee must avoid, he must be void of all of them. Hand guile, by forgerie, false measure, or false weight, theft, cheating, and all cosenage. Lippe guile, by lying, false swearing, false accusing. Heart guile, by Hypocrisie, and all Dissimulation.</p>
            <p>There is a <hi>Do lus bonus,</hi> the Civilian saith, some guile is good. The Nurse, and the Physitian, both beguile, the one her Infant, the other his Patient: shee to please it, hee to ease him, neither to hurt either. Christ meanes not this. Warres have their w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>les; <hi>Dolus an virtus,</hi> no man askes in an enemie. Neither meanes he that. Womens paint, I would I could excuse that too. Many a good Israelite (I doubt not) uses it. But it is a folie fits not a good Israelite.</p>
            <p>But there is <hi>Pia fraus,</hi> a godly guile, a guile of pietie, practised by Papists, and avoucht by them; as Pardons, and Purgatory. They know, they are false both. But it is good the people should beleeve them, good for them, good for the Pope. Two points, the one comfortable to the soule, the other profitable against sinne, good policie to preach them. Thou art a Preacher, so am I. Thou wilt preach them for their good. Doe, if thou be a Catholike; I will not for their guile. Thou art pious toward men, whose soules thou commiseratest; but impious towards God, whose truth thou adulteratest. Christ saith to God, his word is truth. Thou pretendest, thou preachest it. What an <hi>ungodly</hi> guile is it, to turne Gods truth into a lie! Let me be called a Calvinist for teaching truth in simplicitie, rather then be a Romanist, in teaching lies in policie.</p>
            <p>Equivocation, an other Popish guile, defended too. But hee that uses it, called by Saint <hi>Austin, detestanda bellua,</hi> a perjur'd, impious, detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Beast. Breach of faith plight to Heretickes, maintained too. I trow a <hi>Dolus pius</hi> too, a godly guile. So grand, and grosse that they denie
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:173124:231"/> the avouching it, and so line one lie with another. Aske <hi>Simancha</hi> else, <hi>Nullo, nullo modo, fides servanda haereticis etiam joramento firmata.</hi> One <hi>nullo</hi> will not serve the Iesuits zeale; hee doubles it, <hi>Nullo, nullo modo,</hi> by no meanes, in no case, faith plight to Heretickes, though bound with Oath, is to be kept. Theres a <hi>Detestanda Bellua,</hi> a dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable beast indeed. But of all men a Iesuite, no Iesuite (let mee double <hi>Nullus</hi> too) not one Iesuite, a true Israelite. Iesuites, <hi>Edomites,</hi> not <hi>Israelites;</hi> not <hi>Iacobs,</hi> but <hi>Esaues</hi> generation. And therefore nick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named not unjustly <hi>Esauvites;</hi> men made of guile, their verie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posture, imposture. Guile in their names, in their weedes, in their words, yea in their oathes. Double in them all; Guile shunnes sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie. Double named, double habited, double tongued, double hearted, two senses to one speech, even when they sweare. Sathans selfe is guilelesse, if Iesuites have no guile. So farre from being free from it, that they avouch the defense of it. <hi>Iesus</hi> himselfe, from whom they take their title, they cite for an example of dissimulation.</p>
            <p>To conclude, Christ calls his <hi>Spouse</hi> a <hi>Dove,</hi> his <hi>Followers Sheepe;</hi> both the most guilelesse and harmelesse of all creatures. Hee will have his to be as <hi>little children;</hi> Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> expressely calls them <hi>Babes;</hi> Babes use no guile. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> forbids them all guile, and all hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie. Christs selfe a true <hi>Israelite,</hi> farre beyond <hi>Nathaneel,</hi> sampled his owne Rule; in his mouth was found no guile: the Lambe of God; and if the sheepe be guilelesse, the Lambe is so much more. As the Iewes were of <hi>Iacob,</hi> so are wee of Christ. If Israels name like us not; let us follow Christ: though indeede a true Israelite, and a true Christian, are both one. To be truely called either, wee must shunne all guile.</p>
            <p>Singlenesse becomes Righteousnesse, Pagan righteousnesse; much more becomes it holinesse, Christian holinesse. Doubling intends, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends deceit. <hi>Pondus &amp; Pondus,</hi> a weight and a weight, a measure and a measure, as <hi>Salomon</hi> Phrases it, double weights and measures, that Tradseman meanes not truth, that useth them. <hi>Cor &amp; cor,</hi> a heart and a heart, as <hi>David</hi> termes it, a double heart, is onely in Dissemblers. Many Heathens abhorred the one: all Christians should loath the other. All should? All doe. The rankest hypocrite hates hypocrisie, detests all guile in others, though hee practise it himselfe. And if hee thought his hypocrisie were spied, hee would forsake it too. But Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans charme, the God of guile, holds his heart, and hardens it; that hee soothes up his soule, with the conceit, hee is not seene. <hi>In deede</hi> he is. No man dissembles with that dexteritie, but he is spied, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted too.

Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; <hi>he kneeled downe;</hi> Fervent; <hi>he cryed out.</hi> Charitable; for his enemies. What craves he? Pardon; <hi>Lay not to their charge.</hi> Pardon for what?

A great, a very great sinne, a multitude of sinnes in one. <hi>But love covers a multitude of sinnes.</hi> The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr in his charity will not aggravate the sinne: that were to pray for vengeance, not for mercy on the sinners.

            <p>The first part of the verse containes but onely circumstance; a word will serve for it. For <hi>Steven</hi> to kneele in prayer, thats not much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable. Heathens doe that; fall downe before their gods. For <hi>Steven</hi> to <hi>cry, cry with a loud voyce,</hi> is no great matter neither. Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters doe that, <hi>Baals</hi> Priests did. What needs Saint <hi>Luke</hi> expresse ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of these, being used of all men? The one, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, the signe of lowlinesse, saith S. <hi>Basil.</hi> The other, <hi>Clamor cordis, flagrantia cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatis,</hi> the hearts cry is from the zeale of love, saith S. <hi>Augustine.</hi> The contention of the voyce, signe of the intention of the Spirit. Both of
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:173124:233"/> these are ordinary. But for Saint <hi>Steven</hi> to <hi>kneele,</hi> and to <hi>cry,</hi> praying for his enemies; to doe that for others, which he did not for himselfe; and those others, the Iewes, which now were murthering him, even stoning him to death, is worthy the observing.</p>
            <p>He had prayed before to his Saviour for himselfe, <hi>Lord Iesus receive my spirit, vers.</hi> 59. Hee neither kneeled, nor cryed in that; Prayed (it seemes) standing, and with low voyce, begging the greatest thing that God could give him, his soules salvation. I love my neighbour, I must, but as my selfe: and charity may, must too, begin at home. Saint <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> here doth more for others, for his persecutours, for his murtherers, then for his owne selfe, then for his owne soule. Show me who can, a parallell in all the booke of God, in Patriarch, or Prophet, or any holy man. None ever did it, but S. <hi>Steven.</hi> Had not their hearts that stoned him, beene harder then the stones, they cast at him, they had earned at their act, and had burst not for anger, as <hi>vers.</hi> 54. but for sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for their sinne. His martyrdom, according to his name, wrought him a Crowne. Christ Crownes his martyrs above other Saints. This act deserves (pardon the word, I meane not merit in the Papists sense) this peerelesse act deserves one pearle, one pretious pearle of glory in his Crowne, above all Martyrs.</p>
            <p>No more of the circumstance; very worthy of large speech; and though used by Heathens, yet beseeming Christians too, to kneele and cry in Prayer. Yea if Heathens used them, Christians should more. Christs selfe did both, kneeled in his agony, cryed on the Crosse; cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed aloud as Saint <hi>Steven</hi> doth, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the same phrase there and here. And though all prayer be not on the knees; all supplication is; tis not else supplication. Leave wee this, and listen what the Martyr saith; <hi>Lord,</hi> (saith he) <hi>lay not this sinne unto their charge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ab Iove principium,</hi> the first word is Gods title, <hi>Lord.</hi> So twas in his prayer for himselfe, the verse before, <hi>Lord Iesus.</hi> Prayer, all prayer begins with Invocation, either his name or title, to whom wee pray, or both. Discretion and good manners teach our suites to men, to begin with compellation. <hi>My Lord,</hi> saith <hi>Bathsabee</hi> to King <hi>David.</hi> O man of God, saith the Captaine to <hi>Elias. My Father,</hi> saith <hi>Iacob</hi> to old <hi>Isaac.</hi> All speech almost is prefaced so. What man speakes to another, but first names, or titles him. Prayer especially craves preface; all prayer, whether petition, <hi>O God be mercifull,</hi> saith the Publican, or thansgiving, <hi>O God, I thanke thee,</hi> saith the Pharisee. Christs selfe samples both; <hi>Father, glorifie thy Sonne</hi> and <hi>Luk. 11. Father, I thanke thee:</hi> bids us doe the like; say, when wee pray, <hi>Our Father which, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lord, lay not this sinne.</hi> There are many Lords Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith. The verse before tells us, what Lord the Martyr meanes; tis there, <hi>Lord Iesus.</hi> I note it, because the <hi>Valentinian</hi> Hereticks denyed to call him Lord. The terme in the New Testament is almost proper to Christ. And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Every tongue must confesse him to be Lord, Phil.</hi> 2. 11. Yet the Father is Lord too, and so is the holy Ghost. But all three are but one Lord, saith the <hi>Athanasian Creede.</hi> Why Christ is titled so, many have taught you, I neede not. Saint <hi>Steven</hi> here meanes him. I will note but that, and leave the preface. The Martyr directs his prayer unto Christ.</p>
            <pb n="431" facs="tcp:173124:233"/>
            <p>God claimes all invocation, God onely. God onely, but not God the Father onely. Both the Sonne and holy Ghost claime that honour too. God seemes to checke this by the Prophet, <hi>Esa 42. I am the Lord, this is my name; and I will not give my glory to another.</hi> Saint <hi>Steven</hi> (I doubt not) had read this; and yet here prayes to Christ, and stiles, him <hi>Lord.</hi> either those words in <hi>Esay</hi> are the speech of the whole Trinitie: for the name of God in Scripture, mostly meanes all the persons. Or say, tis God the Father that speakes there: yet thereby others, hee meanes Idolls: to them he will not give his glory. Man shall not worship them, but him.</p>
            <p>God will not give his glory unto others. Gods Sonne and his Spirit, are not others, but Gods selfe. Hee will communicate his honour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them; for they are God. God is but one though three persons. What honour is done unto any of the three, is done to all. The Creede at our Communions, cald commonly the <hi>Nicene Creede,</hi> but is not so, but the Creede of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> saith of the holy Ghost, <hi>that with the Father and the Sonne, hee together is glorified.</hi> I may say the same of either of the other, that the Sonne with the Father and the Spirit, or the Father with the Spirit and the Sonne together is glorified. Saint <hi>Steven</hi> here robs not the Father in praying to the Sonne. It is no rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berie for Christ to be equall with God. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Christ thought it none.</hi> To pray to all the persons <hi>junctim</hi> or <hi>divisim,</hi> either to all joyntly, or to any one apart, Christs Church hath ever used. <hi>Veni Creator Spiritus,</hi> is an ancient Hymne in the beginning of your <hi>Psalme.</hi> bookes, a prayer to the holy Ghost. Saint <hi>Steven</hi> is the first after Christs death, that prayes to Christ; first, but not alone. I pray your patience; tis no ordinary theme.</p>
            <p>One antient Father, <hi>Origen;</hi> some moderne Divines, Ministers in <hi>Hungarie,</hi> tie prayer to God the Father onely. This indeede is robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Sonne and holy Ghost. All the persons are peeres. This makes the second and third lesse then the first. Nay it makes them no Gods, with <hi>Arius</hi> and <hi>Macedonius.</hi> To controll both which heresies, the Church devised that religious Doxologie, <hi>Glory be to the Father, to the Sonne and holy Ghost.</hi> Thats a forme of thanksgiving, which is one kind of prayer, due alike to all the persons, because every one is God. <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gens</hi> Iudgement his many other errours lighten: and yet haply the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion is but fatherd on him by some heretickes. For I find this speech in <hi>Origen, Veneratur Patrem, qui admiratur Filium,</hi> He honours the Father, that worships the Sonne. Nay, hee cals Christ <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiall to his Father. He cannot deny him Invocation, that holds that. For the Ministers of <hi>Hungary;</hi> the Spirit of <hi>Servetus,</hi> that blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous Spanish hereticke, that termed the Trinity, <hi>Tricipitem Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berum,</hi> the three headed dogge of hell, I thinke possessed them. They acknowledged God imparted Divinity to Christ, granted him God, but how? Not by eternall generation, but by Grace; <hi>Factum, non Natum,</hi> a God, but made, not borne. Vpon that unsound ground they founded this grosse errour, that Invocation is not due to Christ.</p>
            <p>There is another scruple, that makes some thinke so too. It is Christs
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:173124:234"/> Mediatourship; that because he is our Advocate, hee is to sue for us, not we to him. That Christians must pray <hi>Per Dominum,</hi> not <hi>Ad Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum, through Iesus Christ,</hi> not unto him. For if I pray to Christ, who is then the Mediatour? Indeed his Intercession most properly and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and his whole Mediation is meant unto his Father. But the second and third Person are not therefore excluded. But that honour is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by name unto the Father, as the fountaine of the Deity. I say, most kindly to his Father, but yet also truely to himselfe: Saint <hi>Cyrill</hi> saith it plainely, saith it twise, <hi>Patri, &amp; Sibiipsi.</hi> Hee Intercedes not to his Father onely, but to himselfe, and to the Spirit; and the same prayer may be both in Christs name, and yet unto Christ too. And as praying to the Father, I cry, Lord heare me for thy Sonnes sake: so also pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Sonne, I may say, Lord Iesus heare me for thine owne sake. All honour was equally due to all the Persons before Christs Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And show me Scripture, who can, that the Word lost any thing by taking flesh. Lord, give mee strength, when I yeeld up my Ghost, to cry with blessed <hi>Steven, Lord Iesus, receive my Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beleeve we not in Christ, as well as in the Father? Christ bids, <hi>Io<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Now Saint <hi>Paul (Rom.</hi> 10.) couples Faith and Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In whom I must beleeve, on him I ought to call. Christ ownes them either both, or neither. Doth any yet doubt of it, rests not in my Reasons, lookes for Scripture? There are brought for it (<hi>Bellarmine</hi> saith) above halfe an hundred Texts. Heare but one. The Prayers of the Saints, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 5. 8. are offered to the Lambe. That Lambe is Christ. Old <hi>Iacob</hi> prayed to him long before Saint <hi>Steven, Gen.</hi> 48. Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe Prayed on earth, is prayed to in Heaven; prayed as Mediatour, is prayed unto, as God. The Prophet <hi>Ioels</hi> words, <hi>Whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord,</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> applies unto Christ. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 13. The Churches perpetuall practise hath prooved this point to be no <hi>Paradox.</hi> All <hi>Liturgies</hi> are full of Prayers unto Christ. <hi>Wee pray thee helpe thy Servants, whom thou hast redeemed with thy pretious blood.</hi> Both Priest and People cry, <hi>Christ have mercy upon us. O God the Sonne, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer of the world, have mercy upon us, miserable sinners. O Christ heare us. O Sonne of David, have mercy upon us. Graciously heare us, O Christ;</hi> And many more. Thats for Petition. And for Thankesgiving, the last Prayer at the Communion is plentifull in that; <hi>O Lord God, Lambe of God, Sonne of the Father,</hi> and so forth; tis too long to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearse.</p>

               <hi>Lay not this sinne</hi> (saith the Martyr) <hi>to their charge,</hi> Saint <hi>Stevens</hi> prayer for his enemies. A Prayer worthy Christs Disciple. Hee was One; not of the Twelve; Christ had many beside them, and Saint <hi>Steven</hi> a better Scholler in this lesson of Charity, then some of them. Certainely he was a true Disciple, had markt his master, and here fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes him: had learnd, what Christ taught either by Life or Lesson. Christ had bid, Pray for your Persecutors; both Bid, and Did; pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for his Crucifiers, <hi>Father forgive them.</hi> So doth <hi>Steven.</hi> Christs owne Domestiques had not learned that. <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> would have prayed for fire from Heaven on the <hi>Samaritanes.</hi> Most men use impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:173124:234"/> curse them, that hurt them. One Brother did another, <hi>Iud. 9. Iotham Abimelech.</hi> A Mother did her Sonne, <hi>Iud. 17. Micahs</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Many good men doe in their Infirmity. Even <hi>Paul</hi> did, an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle; curst not onely the Coppersmith, <hi>The Lord reward him, &amp;c.</hi> That haply was (as Saint <hi>August.</hi> speakes,) not <hi>Votum Optantis,</hi> but <hi>Spiritus Prophetantis,</hi> rather the spirit of Prophesie, then the wish of Revenge. But <hi>Paul</hi> in his impatiency curst the High Priest, <hi>God smite thee, thou whited wall.</hi> Not onely not to curse, but to pray for them, that wrong us, is a great degree of grace.</p>
            <p>The degree of Grace the greater, the grander the wrong was. Poore is his patience, and he a weake Christian, that will not put up a light in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury; that, give him but the lie, will stab. But hee that seekes my Blood, that sheds my blood, to pray for him; I doe not say, to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don him; many will doe that, but will put over the revenge to God: but to pray to God for him, not slightly neither, as I haply may, say, God forgive him: but with bended knees, and strained voice, to cry, Lord, lay not this sinne unto his charge; His heart to earne for pity towards them, whose hearts burst for anger toward him; to cry with a loud voice in Gods eares for them, who shouted with loud voice, and stopt their eares at him: this craves a <hi>Steven,</hi> a Christian full of Grace, full of Fortitude, <hi>full of Faith, full of the holy Ghost.</hi> They are the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, Saint <hi>Luke</hi> gives Saint <hi>Steven</hi> in the beginning of this story. This Patience Sathan thought surpast Mans power; prayed God to try <hi>Iob</hi> better. He had lost his Goods and Children; he bore that, blest God for all that losse. He prayed God to touch his Person; and yet not his life neither, but his body: he doubted not, but <hi>Iob</hi> would curse God to his face. Yea and his Wife wisht him so, <hi>Curse God, and Dye. Iob</hi> did not; and the world admires his patience. Saint <hi>Iames</hi> cites it for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, <hi>Audistis, you have heard of Iobs patience.</hi> Saint <hi>Stevens</hi> is greater. Sathan smote <hi>Iob</hi> but with an evill boile, the phrase is so. But the Iewes put <hi>Steven</hi> here to an evill death. Yet hee praies for them; and that even while the stones are battering of his body. Saint <hi>Luke</hi> saith, he wrought wonders, great wonders and miracles among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Surely this prayer for his enemies is one; and not his face onely, as Saint <hi>Luke</hi> saith here too, but his grace was also, as the grace of an Angell. Christ did the same before him, but who else? Not one in the whole Bible, among all the Sonnes of men, saving the Sonne of Man.</p>
            <p>This be said in generall of Saint <hi>Stevens</hi> Prayer. There are in it three particulars, the Pardon, the Sinners, and the Sinne. They are so in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the Originall, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. For the first, many a good man hath zeale, but without knowledge. Great is Saint <hi>Stevens</hi> zeale here, to pray for enemies, on his knees, and with strong cry. But knowes he, what he askes? Christ said to <hi>Zebedees</hi> Sonnes, <hi>Yee know not, what ye aske.</hi> Doth <hi>Steven? Lord, lay not, &amp;c.</hi> Shall man finne, and God not censure? the just judge justifie an unjust man. An earthly Iudge must not, but the Iudge of Heaven may. God lookes not upon sinners as man does. God lookes on them through Christ, if they have Faith. Their sins Christ on the Crosse took to himself, satisfied God for them.
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:173124:235"/> God will not lay them to their charge. But the faithlesse mans sinne, God will impute to him: Christ hath not borne it, himselfe must. I but paraphrase this point; tis plaine. Lay <hi>Stevens</hi> Prayer to Christs; it hath the same sense; <hi>Father, forgive them.</hi> Father, forgive them, saith Christ: <hi>Lord, lay not this sinne to their charge,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To <hi>their</hi> charge? Whose charge? thats the next Question, who they are, for whom he praies. Men of diverse Provinces, but Iewes All, Synagogue men, <hi>chap. 6. ver.</hi> 9. Libertines, <hi>i.</hi> Romanes, <hi>Cyre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, Cilicians,</hi> and some of <hi>Asia,</hi> and <hi>Alexandria;</hi> All belike then in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> besides the common people, <hi>vers.</hi> 12.

So is truth wont to suffer of schisme, and heresie. Our Fathers have seene it both in King <hi>Henries,</hi> and Queene <hi>Maries</hi> dayes. Whom they could not turne with words, they would burne with fire. Yet skills it much, when wrong is offered, who offers it. All these were, if not of <hi>Stevens</hi> Country, of his Kinne; his Brethren, All Israelites, though not borne in <hi>Iudea,</hi> yet Iewes All. <hi>Necessarii, Adversarii;</hi> twas Christs case before him: <hi>Hee came unto his owne, and his owne received him not.</hi> Not that onely; but betrayed him, murthered him. Whose pens are so impudent, whose tongues so virulent against us, as the English Romanists? <hi>Garnet, Faux,</hi> and the rest of that pestilent Pouder-plot, were not French, nor Spanish, but English men All. A Prophet cannot die, but at <hi>Ierusalem; Steven</hi> not be stoned, but by his owne Countrymen. <hi>Etiam Saul inter Prophetas?</hi> Even <hi>Saul</hi> himselfe is one of them. <hi>Pauls</hi> selfe confesseth it, <hi>chap.</hi> 22. He cast not a stone at him; but hee kept their cloathes that did. For these this Martyr prayes, <hi>Lord,</hi> (saith hee) <hi>lay not this sinne unto their charge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You see the sinners, heare the sinne, Lord, lay not <hi>this Sinne.</hi> What sinne? Sinnes are not equall, as some say, as some lying Papists say, we say. There is a sinne, a mote, a gnat; and there is a sinne, a beame, a Camel, an Elephant sinne. Such an one is this. Saint <hi>Steven</hi> cals it not so; lessens it rather in his love; covers it at least, saith but in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, <hi>This Sinne.</hi> He does not aggravate it, call it great; thinkes it no good argument, to moove Gods mercy, to call it great. <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>O God be mercifull to my sinne, for it is great. Steven</hi> does not, prayes God to pardon it, saith but <hi>this sinne.</hi> Nor does <hi>David</hi> haply, examine his words well. I rather would read it, and the Hebrew word beares it, <hi>Lord be mercifull to my sinne, though it be great.</hi> But though the Martyr hide their sinne; the Preacher may not. What is then the sinne? Tis fit, we search it, lest haply it be such, as beares no pardon. Some sins are such, unpardonable: God must lay them to mens charge. <hi>Cain</hi> said, <hi>his sinne was greater, then could be forgiven.</hi> It was not; twas but his despaire: had he had faith, he had found grace. But there is indeed a sinne, God pardons not; the sinne against the holy Ghost. Theres no praying for that. Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> saith, Christs selfe saith, thats unpardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. <hi>Mat. 12. 31. This Sinne</hi> is not. There is one here at the least, one of these persecutors, whom God pardoned. Haply there were many; we
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:173124:235"/> are sure one was. Tis <hi>Saul.</hi> God laid not this sinne, this great sinne to his charge; heard <hi>Stevens</hi> prayer for him.</p>
            <p>The sin is great. <hi>David</hi> titles his sin by a pregnant terme, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the Hebrew word sounds both <hi>Magnum &amp; Multum;</hi> such as was his sinne in the matter of <hi>Vrias,</hi> many sinnes in one, Adultery, Murther, and treachery. So is this here a compound sinne; persecution blood, innocent blood, shed not by legall sentence of Iudge, but in popular rage, subornation of false witnesses. Persecution is great sinne, though without blood. Hee that but binds onely, or banisheth, is a perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutour. <hi>Iulian</hi> was a great one, though no blood-shedder. Here is Blood.</p>
            <p>Blood may be but by stripes, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was scourged often. Blood shed unjustly any way, is sinne, great sinne. But here is murther, the greatest sinne of the Sixe in the second table. God bids, <hi>thou shalt not kill.</hi> Kill I may mine enemy in warre. And the Iudge justly executes the Malefactour in peace. But to kill else, is murther, if in malice; a grand sinne. <hi>Philo</hi> saith, it is sacriledge. For man is Gods Image, a divine Creature; it steales him. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Philoes</hi> words, It robs God of his Creature. A crying sinne, Scripture calls it. Saint <hi>Steven</hi> must make for it a crying Prayer. Blood so shed God abhorres, <hi>Psalme</hi> 5. 6. Revenges ever. Not in <hi>Ioab</hi> onely, and <hi>Absalon,</hi> wicked men; but in his dearest children. <hi>Qui gladio ferit, gladio perit,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>he that sheds mans blood, by man shall his blood be shed. David</hi> escapt not. <hi>Vriahs</hi> blood shed by him, made his be shed: not indeed in himselfe, but in his Sonnes. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> scapt not. He shed <hi>Stevens</hi> blood, kept their cloathes, that shed it. <hi>Nero</hi> shed his.</p>
            <p>This sin yet greater, innocent blood; <hi>Naboths</hi> guiltles blood cost much blood, <hi>Ahabs, Iezabels, &amp; Iehorams, Steven</hi> had not trespast. Greater yet, Saints blood. It in Gods sight is pretious, <hi>David</hi> saith. All blood cries for revenge: Saints blood cries strongly. <hi>Steven</hi> must cry with loud voice, praying for <hi>it. Abels</hi> blood cost <hi>Cain</hi> deare. Saints blood, God bids, <hi>Nolite tangere,</hi> touch not Prophets blood. S. <hi>Steven</hi> was none. Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles blood. <hi>Steven</hi> was one, one saith. S. <hi>Austine</hi> calles him <hi>Apostolum.</hi> Why not a Prophet too, if to Preach, be to Prophesie? Preach he did; this Chapter is his Sermon. Thats not all in this sinne, heres no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Magistrate, no Iudges warrant for Saint <hi>Stevens</hi> death; exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution without writ, or sentence. It might be murther, though by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Magistrate. Even the Magistrate, if he execute unjustly, is a murtherer. Christ was condemned by <hi>Pilate,</hi> and yet <hi>Steven</hi> cals the Iewes murtherers, <hi>v.</hi> 52. Saint <hi>Steven</hi> here was not sentenced, was brought before the Councell, and accused: but not condemned. But the franticke people ranne upon him furiously; violently drew him from the Barre, cast him out of the City, and stoned him.</p>
            <p>The kind of death, they put the Martyr to, adds to the Sinne. <hi>Herod</hi> kild <hi>Iames,</hi> but with the Sword. So dyed <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> too, beheaded both. Of deathes, that kind is the least odious, held least dishonour for highest Persons to die so. Stoning is the death, which <hi>Moses</hi> Law or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained for blasphemers. This death these bloodshedders will have Saint <hi>Steven</hi> die, as holding his Preaching of Christ to be blasphemy.
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:173124:236"/> Thus here not Saint <hi>Steven</hi> onely, but Christ is also persecuted.</p>
            <p>Yet one thing more in this sinne, and I will end it. It is a sinne great enough already. But these Synagogue men, to make it greater yet, suborne false witnesses. They had done so against Christ. Thats an high wickednesse. Themselves to have accused him wrongfully, had beene bad enough: but to suborne others, is grand impudence. As much Penance enjoyned by old Canons to false witnesses, as to adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, felons, or murtherers. Yea the Lawes of the twelve Tables adjudged them to death. I want the Spirit and Power of some Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers here sometimes, to aggravate this sinne, as it deserves. This sin, this great, this grievous, this outragious sinne, superlatively great, <hi>this sinne</hi> (as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> speakes) <hi>out of measure sinnefull;</hi> this Martyr, this first Martyr, full of Faith, and Power, and of the holy Ghost; this Prayer, this passionate, and powerfull Prayer; humble, on the knee, earnest, with a cry, this sinne, this Martyr, makes this Prayer for. God would not let his Prayer to be lost. On how many God had mercy, wee know not. On <hi>Saul</hi> he had, who was one of this mad multitude. Him the Lord pardoned, turned <hi>Saul</hi> to <hi>Paul.</hi> And sweete Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> doubted not to say, <hi>Si Stephanus non orasset, Ecclesia Paulum non habuisset,</hi> Christs Church had lackt Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> but for Saint <hi>Stevens</hi> Prayer. For this blessed Martyr, and All other holy Saints; but especially for the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred incarnation of Christ Iesus, be given unto God, <hi>Father, Sonne, and Holy Ghost, all Honour, and Thankesgiving, this Day, and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE desire of the <hi>Athenians</hi> to be further yet informed of the Doctrine taught by Saint <hi>Paul:</hi> not, that they liked of it (for they censure it for New) but of meere curiositie. The next verse notes their nature, they were <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, they loved to heare <hi>new</hi> things.

            <p>For the first; tis here but <hi>Possumus, May</hi> we know? Tis <hi>Volumus</hi> in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the next verse, we <hi>will</hi> know. Where there is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, love of newes, there must be <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, lust to heare. The <hi>Athenian</hi> eares itcht after newes: they gave themselves to little else; to <hi>nothing</hi> else, Saint <hi>Luke</hi> saith. <hi>Paul</hi> preacht strange things, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, not heard before: heare them they must, they will. They had brought him into their <hi>Mars</hi> streete, a spacious place, that all might heare.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Athens</hi> more equall to the Gospell than <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> Iewes will not heare: they stopt their eares at Saint <hi>Stevens</hi> Apologie. More equall than <hi>Ephesus;</hi> they shouted against <hi>Alexander,</hi> to smother his voice. More equall than <hi>Rome;</hi> they will smother him with smoke, burne him with fagot, that shall preach Christ to them, as he should be preacht.
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:173124:237"/> The Priests and Elders clapt up the Apostles, that durst preach him. Let them preach in prison to the walls; the people should not heare them, nor would <hi>they.</hi> These here heare willingly, eagerly, importune the Apostle; indeede opportune him: tis <hi>his</hi> desire too, to preach the Gospell.</p>
            <p>This passion in this people springs from the subject of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Doctrine. He preacht of <hi>Iesus,</hi> and the <hi>Resurrection.</hi> They tooke them to be gods both. Why else charge they Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the verse before to set forth new gods? Heathens have femall gods, as well as male: Such an one they thought the Resurrection. Tis not my conceit; it is <hi>Theophylacts.</hi> For why not <hi>Anastasis,</hi> as well as <hi>Nemesis?</hi> Many strange gods have <hi>Painims</hi> worshipped. Some Christians have. What a sort of idle gods did the <hi>Valentinian</hi> Heretickes devise. Thinking <hi>these</hi> to be gods too, they give him open audience. They are <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, somewhat superstitious. They were loath there should be any gods, whom they worshipt not, and therefore they urge Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to second his Doctrine more <hi>openly</hi> and amply.</p>
            <p>Though <hi>Mars</hi> street indeed were the publike Sessions house; yet Saint <hi>Paul</hi> is not brought thither, as convented by the Magistrate. My Text is not the speech of the Iudges to examine him, but of the people fairely entreating him, to speake freely and at large. Some calamities had lesson'd them to neglect no gods: they worshipt all <hi>implicitè,</hi> knowne or unknowne. They had inscribed one Altar purposedly, <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noto Deo, to the unknowne God.</hi> But thats but part of the Inscription, there was more, To the Gods of <hi>Asia, Europe,</hi> and <hi>Lybia.</hi> There should not be a God in all the world, but they would worship him. In this superstitious suspition of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> doctrine, though they censure it for new; yet they will heare it better. <hi>Iesus &amp; Resurrectio</hi> might haply be Gods: Saint <hi>Paul</hi> must preach againe; <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>they will know,</hi> (they say) <hi>what he meanes.</hi>

            <p>Their <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, their desire to heare the Apostle I can not condemne simply: rose it not of superstition, tis commendable to heare. <hi>Omnia probate, Prove all things,</hi> approve truth onely. Should not the <hi>Gentiles</hi> have given the Apostles, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> and the rest the hearing; how should the Gospell have beene preacht throughout the world? The seeds of salvation have beene sowen in all lands? Their <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely naught; but their <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, is in part commendable. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               <hi>Iustin Martyr</hi> saith, the worship of many gods is sister to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theisme, he feares not any, that hath many. But their zeale to heare must not be censured too severely. Onely two things I taxe in it, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, love of Noveltie, and Superstition.</p>
            <p>The former, <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>Newes</hi> is curiositie, idle vanitie: but a vanitie the more veniall, because tis harmelesse, void of malice, and tis naturall. Most men, if not all, <hi>Avidi nimis auricularum,</hi> saith <hi>Lucretius,</hi> too at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive to reports, every eare arrected at the noise of newes. [<hi>Mitte quod scio, dic quod nescio,</hi> what we know, is stale; things unheard and fresh please us.] Pardon the <hi>Athenians</hi> this infirmitie, Heathen <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians.</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, it should be found in Christians, they should have itching eares. I would wee had not humourous Hearers, admiring or
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:173124:237"/> adoring rather the new conceits of every novellist. An <hi>Atticke</hi> homour, an appetite to heare, <hi>Caninus appetitus,</hi> an unsatiable hunger and desire to heare. But the ground of the desire, not <hi>veritas,</hi> but <hi>novitas;</hi> tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the loue, not of truth, as the honourable <hi>Berrhaeans</hi> were, that would <hi>search, whether the things were true which they had heard;</hi> but of noveltie. It is some weakenesse in civill things, but in religion a great infirmitie.</p>
            <p>The other superstition, thats a sinne worthy censure. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> checks them with it, but very gently. He hoped for a greater Harvest, then he found, and therefore toucht them, but very tenderly. He layes the terme on them; but allayes it withall, loath to exasperate them, whom he would convert. I pray you see his Art, his godly Art. Hee will not betray God by concealing their Idolatry; but yet he will tell it them in mildest phrase: he will not sooth their sinne, but yet will sooth his termes. <hi>I see you</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>O yee men of Athens, quasi superstitiosiores, as it were, somewhat superstitious.</hi> The comparative degree (Grammarians know) signifies sometimes <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, though mostly it increase, yet it is sometimes a <hi>Terminus diminuens;</hi> not <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, somewhat superstitious. Nay hee thinkes it yet too tart, puts a <hi>Quasi</hi> to it too, to make it yet more milde, I see you (men of <hi>Athens</hi>) as it were somewhat superstitious. Tis a Pill, and therefore he gives it gilt. He speakes to <hi>Athenians:</hi> they have <hi>Teretes aures,</hi> as dainty in their sense as in their dialect. Yea and the word it selfe hath an <hi>Euphemismus</hi> too: for <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is one that feares the Gods. They worshipt indeede devills. <hi>Moses</hi> cald them so, so doth the <hi>Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> i.</hi> devills. The heathens Gods (saith <hi>David</hi>) <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, devills all: Idolls at the best. S. <hi>Paul</hi> will not call, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a fig, a fig, will not terme them Idolaters (that might nettle them indeede, indan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger him, and harden them) but onely superstitious, <hi>as it were somewhat superstitious.</hi> The best is bad: superstition is impiety.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Athenian</hi> appetite, to heare of God, purgd of these two ill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, curiositie and superstition, I would it were in every English heart. <hi>Romans</hi> sent their sonnes to <hi>Athens</hi> to learne there. I would our Romanists would learne this <hi>Atticisme.</hi> Till the Bull of <hi>Pius quintus</hi> about the eleventh yeare of Queene <hi>Elisabeth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> raigne, all Papists came to Church, prayed with us, heard the word with us. Now multitudes refuse. Our doctrine now the same as then. That Bull-master Pope <hi>Impius,</hi> and his successours since, now <hi>Saul</hi> the fifth and all, have chargd the children of their holy mother Church, to avoyd our assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies. Some haply come for feare of fine: but as it was said of one, their eares are stopt with Cotten, stuft lest they should heare. This unhappy generation, that can Romanise so much, I heartily wish they would Athenise a little; aske their devout fathers, or rather their owne hearts, may wee not know what this new doctrine is? Vnhappy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusants, miserable thralls, suffer not this servitude. Though your ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannising Bishop bind you hand and foote, and say of our Sacraments, <hi>touch not, tast not, handle not:</hi> yet be not eare-bound too. The Pope is but Christs Vicar. Heare what Christ saith himselfe; <hi>he that hath eares to heare, let him heare.</hi>

            <pb n="440" facs="tcp:173124:238"/>
            <p>Say, the Popish doctrine be the undoubted truth: I trow, it is not tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then the Gospell. The men of <hi>Berrhaea</hi> would not trust it, till they had tryed it, examined it by Scriptures. They thought the doctrine preacht by <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Sylas</hi> might haply bee false: they knew not from what spirit they spake. And is it <hi>Piaculum,</hi> Papists should thinke it pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, errour to be in poperie? that they may not dare, not so much as reade, not so much as heare any thing printed, any thing preached by a Protestant? A presumption rather (would they weigh things wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) that their doctrine is unsound, against which they will not let them either reade or heare any thing objected. Surely wee shall not neede either in our bookes or Sermons oppose against them any argument of ours. What one point hold, they crosse to us, which some even of themselves doth not controll? and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> will tell them, that, that is not to be held as a point of faith, which some catholicks have crost, whom the Church hath not condemned. This <hi>Atticisme</hi> then is not absurd, to heare at least, what our doctrine is; except their owne were more undoubted. May they not heare, what this <hi>new doctrine</hi> is? They may, though it be new. <hi>That</hi> is the second member of my Text, the censure of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> doctrine, it is <hi>new.</hi>

            <p>But tis unjust. The doctrine of the Gospel as antient as the world, to be charged for a noveltie?

To them false Gods are antient; and the true is new. Things sometimes are cald new, not of their owne nature; but because new persons come to know them. To the man borne blinde, when Christ had given him sight, all things seemed new to him. Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren take forth new lessons out of old bookes.

But his incarnation, and all other things concerning him were both foretold, and prefigured long before: foretold by the Prophets, and prefigured in the Law. Both it, and they taught Christ should come. We reckon two Testaments, an old and a new: but there is but one, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

            <p>Tis now no new doctrine which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> preacht tot the <hi>Athenians,</hi> though it sounded so to them; new to their ears, but indeed ancient. That censure served their owne Religion, and fitted their gods. They rather were new. Even <hi>Moses</hi> was elder then the Gentiles gods, <hi>Eusebius</hi> saith. The antientest of them all, even <hi>Saturne</hi> himselfe was Puinee unto him, <hi>Tertullian</hi> saith. <hi>Athenagoras</hi> makes <hi>Orpheus propè coaetaneum,</hi> almost as old as they, and <hi>Moses</hi> was his antient.</p>
            <p>Hath this age no <hi>Athenians? Plinie</hi> cals part of <hi>Italie, Magnam Graeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,</hi> great Greece. Then <hi>Athens</hi> must be <hi>Rome;</hi> it is the eye of <hi>Italie,</hi> as <hi>Athens</hi> was of <hi>Greece.</hi> Surely <hi>Romanists</hi> serve us, as <hi>Athenians</hi> served Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> The Papist saith the Protestants Religion is new doctrine. First, say it were: what if it be new, so that it be true? <hi>Quasi antiquitas</hi> (saith Saint <hi>Augustine) praejudicet veritati,</hi> as though anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity must needs out countenance truth. Well sayd <hi>Arnobius, quod ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum est, serum non est,</hi> truth comes never <hi>tardè.</hi> But tis not; the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Religion is not new.</p>
            <pb n="442" facs="tcp:173124:239"/>
            <p>Surely if it be; tis <hi>very</hi> New. For he raigned but in our Fathers dayes, whom the Pope first stiled <hi>Defender of the Faith.</hi> I trow that was the ancient Faith, the old Religion. Tis so, they meane; they say, our moderne Faith was not heard of in the world till King <hi>Edward</hi> the sixths raigne. By their leaves, it peered a little in his Fathers dayes. Be like the Faiths Defender plaid false too. So it is a little elder than King <hi>Edward.</hi> Themselves say, <hi>Luther</hi> first founded it in King <hi>Henries</hi> time. Till then tis most manifest that all in <hi>England</hi> were Papists without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. One <hi>Hill,</hi> a Popish Doctor saith it. Our learned Archbishop observes his Hyperbolees, makes mole-hills both of them and him. He saith not onely manifest, but most manifest; not that many but even all; to make it yet more sure, All without exception, were Papists untill then. It was <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Zwinglius</hi> were the unfortunate Fathers of the <hi>English</hi> Faith, another of them saith. Lyars neede better memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
            <p>Not heard of in the world till <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth? All Papists, none excepted till <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth? Was there not in the world one <hi>Wickliffe</hi> before them? long before them? Him they must except. Or wherefore else burnt they his bones? Though King <hi>Henry</hi> 8. were Defender of the Faith, and the Pope that so titled him, meant the Romish faith: yet both in his raigne, and before it, there were Defenders of the true Faith, I meane this new Faith, that defended it with their bloud, as King <hi>Henrie</hi> did the old with his Pen. His Majestie now doth, not the new, but the true, hath already with his pen too; is ready with his sword; &amp; had with his bloud too, had their bloudy Project prospered. King <hi>Henries</hi> Father and Grandfather before him, <hi>Henry</hi> the 6. and his father before him, and others many before them, many Martyrs, moe Confessers, multitudes of professers of this new doctrin. Some <hi>Homilies,</hi> yet remaining in the Saxon tongue shew our Church of this Faith even before the Conquest. I must <hi>Grandire gradum,</hi> fetch greater strides to the Antiquitie of our Faith, lest the houre silence me. It began not at <hi>Wittinberg,</hi> as <hi>Stapleton</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, at <hi>Prage,</hi> at <hi>Lyons:</hi> It were then true, which they say of us, <hi>Hester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni sumus</hi> twere but a yesterday faith. But it is the Doctrine of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Fathers. Yea antienter than they; the Doctrine of the Apostles; of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> whom <hi>Iustin</hi> calls <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the Father of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Not one point of our faith; which many learned Writers of our <hi>English</hi> Church have not rescued from this false imputation of Novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; avoucht and averr'd it to be antient and Apostolicke against the stoutest adversarie.</p>
            <p>Our Doctrine new; but like Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> new Commandement, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. the same (saith he) which wee heard from the beginning. It was to love one another. Christ call'd it new too, <hi>Iohn</hi> 13. 34. but it was in <hi>Moses</hi> Law, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19. Christ saith it is, oftner than once. <hi>Haman</hi> told <hi>Assuerus</hi> there was a people in his land, he meant the <hi>Iewes;</hi> who used <hi>Novis legibus, new lawes.</hi> But those lawes <hi>Moses</hi> gave them too. Are not the Scriptures too new doctrine in our tongue, and in every tongue, save in the Latin? For no man may have them in the mother tongue. Even the Lords Prayer, which our Saviour made himselfe, and the Apostles Creed, the very Christian Faith in <hi>English</hi> is new
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:173124:239"/> Doctrine. Men must pray in <hi>Latin</hi> too. What an Egyptian darkenesse doth <hi>Rome</hi> hold all men in, to hide the lewdnesse of their old lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning?</p>
            <p>But I trow, their faith is ancient, that challenge ours for new. Their Doctrine, <hi>All</hi> is Apostolicall. Our Faith began at <hi>Wittinberg,</hi> theirs at <hi>Ierusalem. Zwinglius</hi> and <hi>Calvin, Martin Luther,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Hus</hi> first Authors of ours: the Apostles and Christs selfe first founders of theirs. Worshipping of Images is Apostolicall: Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> bids <hi>Custodite, Keepe your selves from Images;</hi> that is, be not so unreverent as to touch or handle them; but worship them a farre off. The Communion in one kinde, thats Christs Doctrine <hi>Implicitè. Drinke ye all of this;</hi> Christ meant <hi>exclusivè, All ye, i.</hi> ye onely; none must drinke, but the Priest. Transubstantiation, who but an Innocent would father that upon Pope <hi>Innocent?</hi> Christ said expressely, <hi>Hoc est corpus meum,</hi> the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine, are his body and his bloud.</hi> Invocation of Saints, hath warrant from Christ also; he cried upon the Crosse, <hi>Eli, Eli, &amp;c.</hi> he called upon <hi>Elias. Breerly</hi> the Priest collects it, Apologie, <hi>pag. 148. med.</hi> The Popes power above the Kings is it not as ancient as Christ too? Was not Christ convented before <hi>Annas</hi> and <hi>Caiphas,</hi> the King of the Iewes before the high Priest?</p>
            <p>Their Dignities and Orders ancient too, not their Doctrine onely. The Popes Prerogatives both before all Bishops, and above them; the one is palpably Apostolicall, the first (saith Saint <hi>Matth.</hi>) is <hi>Simon;</hi> theres his Primacie, for hee is <hi>Peters</hi> Successor: the other is from Christ, thou art <hi>Cephas;</hi> that signifies in Greeke a Head; theres his Supremacie. The Cardinalls more ancient, <hi>Elias</hi> in his <hi>Thisbi,</hi> saith the <hi>Italian</hi> Iewes finde them in the <hi>Psalmes.</hi> The Iesui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es elder yet. Why father they their Order on <hi>Ignatius Loiola?</hi> Tis yet but foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score yeares, since <hi>Loiola</hi> lived. Tis their great modestie. They are farre more ancient, ancienter than the Fathers, than the Apostles, than Christ <hi>Iesus</hi> himselfe from whom they have their name, was after them. Ancienter than the Prophets, Looke <hi>Num.</hi> 26. 44. there shall you finde the Ingendrer of the Iesuites, <hi>Iebusites</hi> and <hi>Esauites</hi> (for so some call them) are names that show them ancient too: but nick-names given them by us of the new Religion. But in that place of <hi>Numbers,</hi> theres the Iesuite indeed. In your <hi>Geneva</hi> Bible it is but Issuites; thats but a new Translation too: but the vulgar Latin, and the old English books have it plainely Iesuites.</p>
            <p>How hath <hi>Rome</hi> brased her brow, to call our Doctrine new, which her conscience tells her came from Christ, her owne Ancient, which is new indeed? Twas ancient once, till she plaied the spirituall harlot, and corrupted it. Tis old now; but none otherwise, than the bread and bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles and shooes of the Giebonites, patcht shewes and mouldy bread.</p>
            <p>To conclude, tis not our Doctrine onely, the Protestants Religion, but the whole Christian Faith is noveltie to <hi>Rome,</hi> both <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, a thing above, but not in <hi>Pauls</hi> sense.</p>
            <p>Another person in the worlds trinity, was pleasure. Many seeke it also; but not so many. I meane not wanton pleasure, lust. Moe seeke it, then honour. Thats rather <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a thing of the flesh, then of the world. I meane Idlenesse, not wantonnesse. Strong drinke, lawfull in time and measure, <hi>inter utenda,</hi> but not <hi>inter quaerenda,</hi> I may use it, but not seeke it. I greeve to heare Lay men censure Church men for this. I would it were irregularitie. Wine, <hi>Paul</hi> bids, <hi>utere,</hi> but <hi>modico, &amp; propter stomachum,</hi> little, and for Physick. But hee in the <hi>Proverbs</hi> 23. 30. seekes it, hunts it, the word signifies: and having found it, abids all day at it: rests not so, but cries at night, <hi>quaeram amplius, I will seeke it againe. Cras sicut hodie, to morrow,</hi> every day.</p>
            <p>Gaming an other idle pleasure. They seeke it most, that are reputed Gentlemen. So may they be by their first birth. But by the second they are not. True generosity, which is Regeneration by Gods holy Spirit, will abhorre so base an exercise, so unfitting a good Christian, so full of falshood and impiety. Surely <hi>Paul</hi> meanes not this. Tis not <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

Wise <hi>Solomon</hi> found no seeking, like that of Silver, <hi>Prov. 2. 4. Quaestus,</hi> gaine hath the name of seeking, <hi>Aquaerendo.</hi> Strong drinke is a strong Witch: and play (they say) bewitcheth too. Yet are many found free from their spells. But Riches are Witches, that enchant almost All. The worlds life, Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> saith, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. his Soule, the Poet saith, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

Or am not I more strickt, then <hi>Paul?</hi> make him meane more, then he does? Is to bid seeke the things above, to forbid to seeke the things below? May we not seeke both? Be Christ Iudge. He bids, <hi>Seeke Gods King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome first, Quaerite primum.</hi> That implies, Mammon may be sought too; so it be afterward.

            <p>Thus will worldlings object; and their speech is very specious. <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donat</hi> allowes it, on that place of <hi>Matthew,</hi> 6. 33. And rejects all other glosses. A man judicious; but a Iesuite. Vnder the censure of more learned judgements, I thinke Saint <hi>Paul</hi> speakes peremptorily; forbids all other seeking, save of things above. Honour should not be sought. It should seeke men, not men it. <hi>Saul</hi> was seeking Asses <hi>David</hi> Sheepe, when <hi>Samuel</hi> sought to annoint them Kings. Twise sought the people to Crowne Christ; He declind it. <hi>Siracks</hi> Sonne bids, <hi>Seeke not, to be a Iudge. Absalom</hi> did, a bad example. And for Church dignity, how many worthy men in ages past, have fled from Bishoprickes, hid them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, some maimed themselves, to be uncapable? A monument of their Sobriety, remaines yet among us in the Election of a Bishop. <hi>Vis Episcopari?</hi> the Person answers, no. No? Why then saith <hi>Paul, 1 Tim. 3. He that desires a Bishopricke, desires a good Worke?</hi> That place hath many answers; every word gives one. First, <hi>Cupere</hi> is not <hi>Quaerere.</hi> I I may desire, what I may not seeke. Then, what if <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap> in that Bishopricke, that must be desired; not the Title, but the Taske. Tis <hi>Nomen Operis, non Honoris,</hi> Saint <hi>August.</hi> desire the Duty, not the dignity. Desire I may; but <hi>prodesse,</hi> not <hi>praesse,</hi> tis Saint <hi>Augustines</hi> too, as a Bishop is a labourer, not as he is a Lord. Else <hi>indecenter petitur,</hi> saith that Father; it is not decent to desire a Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke. I may <hi>Sumere,</hi> but not <hi>Petere,</hi> (tis not my distinction) Accept of Honour, but not seeke it. Tis from God, if sent: if sought, tis from below.</p>

            <p>I have dwelt long upon the Object. To end it, the sensuall man wil thinke Saint <hi>Paul</hi> much too rigorous, to tie us that are below, to seeke things, that are above. Man is indeede earthly, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> said, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>: but not wholy so; not made all of one Element. There is fire in man too, not earth onely. God breathed a soule into him. Thats <hi>Nomen frigidum, Tertullians</hi> terme. The soule (he meanes in Greeke) is call'd by name, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

The woman in Christs Parable, having lost but a groate, lighted a candle, swept the house for it, and sought diligently. <hi>Marie</hi> missing her Sonne, went backe a dayes journey to enquire for him: not so finding him, spent three dayes more in seeking him. Twas Christ, shee sought: but shee sought him, but as a sonne. Things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove are above sonnes. The hearing and obeying of Gods Word, Christs selfe preferres before all kindred.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iudah</hi> sought God <hi>tota voluntate,</hi> with their whole will, 2 <hi>Chron. 15. Moses</hi> bids, <hi>seeke him, toto corde, with the whole heart,</hi> There is a see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king without wish to find, to seeke unwillingly, and there is a willing seeking, without joy in finding; to seeke, but not heartily. The one would not find at all; the other cares not much to finde. Thats when the Object is base, or not pleasing. But the worth of things above, craves both will and heart, the whole will, and the whole heart of all that seeke them.</p>

               </gap>, things below. So seeke thou things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove. What adventures not the Merchant for his gaine? Seekes it <hi>per saxa, per ignes,</hi> by perills, like to <hi>Paul,</hi> on land, on sea, of Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, of wrecke, in watching and wearinesse, cold, hunger, and thirst. Theres one in Christs Parable, that sought pearles. Lighting upon one of price, went and sold all he had, to purchase it. A man for Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, will doe, that is homely, weare that is course, rise up earely, lie downe late, eate the bread of sorrow, holds himselfe happie, if he may finde it, seeking so. The itch of Honour, scratch till the bloud come, twill abide. Twill fawne and flatter, promise and bribe, dissemble inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, beare indignitie, hazard limme and life. <hi>Absolom,</hi> to raigne, will kisse and congee every man, he meets. The wonton, how watcheth he his opportunities, sends presents to his <hi>Dalilah,</hi> hazards Reputation, state, and life, to serve his lust?

               </gap>, but <hi>dung,</hi> Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> terme, compared with things above. How much more seriously ought wee to seeke the things above!</p>
            <p>Prayer is one kinde of seeking. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, first and more. Learne that by the Lords Prayer. The <hi>Hallowing of Gods Name, Comming of his Kingdome, and Doing of his Will,</hi> sets before <hi>Daily Bread;</hi> and but of sixe petitions, five for spiritual things; but one for temporall. The Prayer earnest; <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> too; it must be fervent. Not like that of Saint <hi>Austins;</hi> who confesseth hee prayed once for Grace, but softly and faintly, fearing least God might
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:173124:243"/> heare him. Reading and hearing Gods Word, thats another kind, and must be with zeale too. The people heard <hi>Ezra</hi> from morne to noone, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> till midnight. Shunne prophane fellowship, save in necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; walke with them onely, that talke of things above. Thats a third kind. Meditate with <hi>David</hi> day and night of Gods Law, and imitate the laudable actions of the righteous; these are kindes also of seeking things above.</p>
            <p>To conclude. [Aske things above of God; but aske not onely. Thats but a peece of seeking. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

As <hi>David</hi> bids, in Peace, so in all the things above, seeke them, and pursue them.] The <hi>Preachers</hi> Rule is too generall, <hi>Whatsoever thou dost, doe it omni valde tuo, with all thy power.</hi> But in this Act it is requisite, this Act upon this Object, Seeking, and Things above, doe it <hi>omni valde tuo,</hi> seeke them with all thy power. As <hi>Bernard</hi> saith of loving God, <hi>Tantum dilige, quantum potes,</hi> I will say of seeking God, <hi>Tantum quaere, quantum potes,</hi> Seeke things above, so much as thou art able. <hi>Mensura tua sit potestas tua,</hi> the measure of thy seeking, must be thy whole might.</p>

One hath summ'd them to a dozen. I finde
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:173124:244"/> eleven: this is the last, as the basest of them all, the most servile of all sinnes: no Act so abject as to <hi>lie.</hi> Into that Act, the doe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> and the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferer my Text sunders it selfe, three Termes, and yet the words but two, but two significant in the Greeke.

A thing so knowne needes no defining. To <hi>lye,</hi> is to speake that is false, wittingly, and with purpose to deceive. Some fetch so much almost out of the word, <hi>Mentiri, est contra men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem ire,</hi> to contradict our owne conscience. But my Text bids, Decline it, not Define it, <hi>Lye not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Law forbad to lye. <hi>Quid Paulo, cum Mose?</hi> What hath the Gospell to doe with the Law? Christians are freed from it. They are from the Curse of it. But they are bound to obey the Law, the mor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>all Law. The Prophet <hi>Moses,</hi> and the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> differ not in the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calogue.</hi> Both have the lesson alike, word for word, differ but in Dialect. He, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19. 11. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> here, <hi>lye not one to another.</hi> Onely Saint <hi>Paul</hi> wrote to Gentiles, <hi>Moses</hi> spake to Iewes. But remember Christs Rule, <hi>Quod dico vobis, dico omnibus;</hi> both <hi>Moses</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> meant their lesson to all people. No lesson more needefull, but no lesson lesse learned. For the one, Truth is the Cement of all humane Societie. One once said wickedly, <hi>Qui nescit dissimulare, nescit vivere.</hi> There were no living, were it not for lyes. Thats a most leud lie. Theres no Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie without Fidelitie, I doe not thinke, the devills doe lye one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Yet no lesson lesse learned. Truth keepes a free Schoole, but very scant of Schollers. Lying is the trade, to which all men binde their sonnes. For to what should they else? It is their Fathers occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. [Handie craftes are painefull, straine the strength. Tongue-craft is easie, costs no sweat.] There is no vertue, but is profest by some, save truth onely. A Patient, a Liberall, a Iust, a Sober man, <hi>Ecce hîc, ecce illic,</hi> you shall light on here and there. <hi>Fidelem autem quis inveniet? But who</hi> (saith <hi>Solomon) shall finde a faithfull man?</hi> No man speakes truth unto his neighbour, every man lyes.</p>
            <p>There is no vice, but some avoid it. <hi>Caius</hi> is no Leacher, <hi>Titius,</hi> no drunkard, <hi>Sempronius</hi> no thiefe; but haply lyars all. Pharisee no Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer, no Extortioner, he saith; but an errant lyar; for an Hypocrite. Wee pardon the Gentiles; their Religion was all lyes. Their gods lyars too. <hi>Mercurie</hi> both a lyer, and a thiefe. We excuse Iewes too in part. The Law bound them from lyes, but the Law alone. But a lye in the mouth of a Christian is a sinne out of measure sinfull. The Gospell binds us too. Yea I will pardon the Papist in part too, though a Christian, as we are. Wee have more light than hee. The Bible is forbidden him: and the Priest preaches seldome. We have the Scriptures free. Not a house almost, but hath, if not a Bible, a Testament at least. We heare divine Service every Sunday, besides the Feasts of Saints, in our owne
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:173124:245"/> tongue, not in Latin, as they doe. And in many Churches Sermons too, two Sermons haply in one day, some three in one weeke. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our lay people presume to reason too of deepe points of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>Yet to the shame of our prosession, to the disgrace of the Gospell, wee all, for all this lye one unto another, with the same tongue sing praysings unto God, and speake leazings to our neighbours. Let no man be offended at my saying, all, say the Peacher lyes in that. Hee that shall, I doubt will not deserve to bee excepted. His conscience will tell him, I belye not him: If I doe hyperbolize, I but doe as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Omnis homo mendax.</hi> Say not, twas in haste: for S. <hi>Paul</hi> cites it to the Romans, as sayd by him advisedly. What he then sayd, wee now see. My calling occasions me a retired life; I cannot observe much. But besides mine owne observing, I heare all men complaine, that not a man almost makes conscience of a lye.</p>
            <p>Some haply will not doubt to give <hi>David</hi> the lye too, for calling all men lyars. Shall I show the generality by Induction? 1. Be beggers first and poore people. Their precedence in this case is no disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to better persons. Tis a base part, ad best beseemes base persons. They professe lying, all lying; their hands also lye. They must lye and steale; else they shall sterve. 2. The Tradesman and Artificer, I will not say professes it; and yet his tongue useth that very terme, when he speakes falsely, saith I professe; Falsehood, he might adde; double falsehood, as the begger did before; hath a lying hand too, not a mouth oely, gives false measure and false waight. 3. The country people, heretofore more just, are now turnd lyars too. 4. Patients complaine of imposture in Physitians; Clients in men of Law. 5. In Courts of judicature, every false answer is alye, ad every wrong sentence is a lye. There are many of the one, too many of the other. 6. The gentleman will not endure the word, but he will doe the thing; speake a lye, sweare it often. Higher it becomes mee not to goe. But <hi>Machiavell</hi> and the Devill have taught Princes to disguise, not to their people onely, but one unto another. To end my induction, I must say of our Land, as the Prophet doth of <hi>Niniveh,</hi> It is full, <hi>universa,</hi> it is all full of lyes.</p>
            <p>You see the act, <hi>Mentiri,</hi> to lye, wee doe it, and it is a precept here, but prophibitive. Heres withall, a <hi>vide ne feceris,</hi> see thou doe it not; <hi>Nolite</hi> saith the Apostle, doe not lye. Why <hi>Nolite,</hi> doe it not? One bids, doe worse, <hi>Iura perjura;</hi> bids sweare, forsweare: as if a lye were too single a sinne, bids line it with an oath. The reasons for the <hi>Nolite</hi> are many, heare a few.</p>
            <p n="1">1. You have heard already, that is base, servile, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Plutarchs</hi> word, a qualitie fitter for a bondslave, then an ingenuous man; and thats the cause a Gentleman forsooth though he lye indeed, yet will stab him, that shall chaleng him. Though hee does it, you may not say he does it. Nay, if I misremember not, it was a Parasite in the comedie, <hi>i.</hi> a servile fellow, that cryed, <hi>Mentiri non est meum,</hi> sayd, it beseemed not him to lye. Insomuch that the <hi>Persians,</hi> a proud people, of the two things they most disdained, made this the one,
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:173124:245"/>
               <hi>Debere &amp; Mentiri,</hi> to be in debt, and to lye. They taught their sonnes from five yeares old to 20, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to ride, and shoote, and to speake exact truth: and one of their Kings, <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded three nayles to bee driven through the tongue of a man, that had lyed to him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whence note, as an <hi>obitèr,</hi> another argument against it, that lying is a vice hatefull even to the Heathens. A man that speakes one thing, meanes another, <hi>Achilles</hi> saith in <hi>Homer,</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, he hated a lyar, as he hated hell.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Another toucht before too, tis from the Devill. Hee made the first lye in the world; and a reprobate made the second, <hi>Cain;</hi> and sO became his sonne. For so Christ saith, the Devill is a lyar, <hi>&amp; Pater ejus,</hi> and his father, <hi>i.</hi> the lyars father, that is, <hi>Cains.</hi> The lyar, Sathans sonne, and <hi>Cains</hi> brother. It is not my conceit, but Saint <hi>Austins.</hi> God make me sonne to <hi>him;</hi> Hee is the God of truth. God make me Christs Disciple; Hee is <hi>Amen.</hi> God lyes not, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith; saith more, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, tis <hi>impossible for God to lye.</hi> Hee can doe all things, but not lye.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Another, tis a wound unto my credit, a mortall wound. He that heares me lye once, will never trust me more. <hi>Ne vera quidem dicenti,</hi> saith the Oratour, no not when I speake the truth. Hee will thinke I lye then also. Nay, <hi>Ne jurato quidem,</hi> one will not trust a lyar, though he sweare. Stab not another for giving thee the lye; thou stab'st thy selfe by making it. As good to dye, as lye. Heard wee it sayd before, <hi>Qui nescit dissimulare, nescit vivere,</hi> I cannot live, if I may not lye? Nay rather but a lyar is a living corpse, a dead man, though hee live. <hi>Civiliter mortuus.</hi> To what end doe I live, if no man will beleeve me? Nay nor wilt thou beleeve another, if thou lye thy selfe: thou wilt doubt, he doth so too. Tis time thy grave bee made when thou wilt not trust thy neighbour, nor thy neighbour may trust thee.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Another worse then this, It makes thee a meere abject, despica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vile creature: not onely none will trust thee, but all will shunne thee, loath thee. <hi>David</hi> will not let a lyar <hi>dwell</hi> with him, no, <hi>not come in his sight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. But one more, but a worse, farre worse then that. God hates the lyar, his soule abhorres him, <hi>Solomon</hi> saith; curses him too, thats worse. The lyar haply cares not for his love: let him hate him, so he hurt him not. But God will destroy him, <hi>David</hi> saith. Hee shall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, his sonne saith, <hi>Solomon.</hi> Worse yet, farre worse. By perishing was meant but temporall woe; he shall have eternall too. He were happy, might he perish, and no more. But the wise man addes, <hi>the mouth that lyes, (occidit animam) slayes the soule.</hi> Thats but <hi>Apocrypha.</hi> But Christ saith (thats canonicall) that without shall be dogges, without, <hi>i.</hi> shut out, shut out of heaven, throwne into hell, whosoever is a lover, or a maker of lyes. Heare me, Oh heare me, miserable man, whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver art a lyar, <hi>miserere animae tuae.</hi> Though thou care not for thy stage, for thy credit, for thy life; yet pittie thy poore soule. Lose not so rich a Iewell for a base lye. Nay tis not lost onely; thou wert happy then, if mans soule perishing were but vanishing, like the beasts. But tis doom'd
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:173124:246"/> to paines eternall, to everlasting fire. Men make lyes light sinnes; see what God makes them, by the paine.</p>
            <p>The rest of my Text will bee woond up in few words: I have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore beene, and shall be yet the longer in this terme, <hi>Nolite, doe not lye.</hi> The Apostles prohibition so abundantly proved, the lyar will not dare deny. But he will distinguish; Logick gives him that leave. Lyes are not all alike: some are but <hi>Iocosa,</hi> other <hi>Officosa,</hi> the worst <hi>Pernitiosa.</hi> The last sort all men grant unlawfull, malitious lyes. The Pope, who dispenseth with all sinnes, cannot with them, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> saith. But haply Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> precept meanes not the other too. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth not in lyes, as Christ did in oaths, put <hi>Omnino</hi> in his precept. He said, <hi>Sweare not at all.</hi> Tis not here, lye not at all. Nay though Christ added <hi>Omnino,</hi> forbad to sweare at all: yet I may sweare sometimes; as when the Magistrate bids. Much more may I lie, since <hi>Omnino</hi> is not here. I answer; first, Christs prohibition was but of swearing privately; and <hi>Omnino</hi> meant not the times of swearing, but the kinds of oaths. <hi>Sweare not at all, i.</hi> not by any thing; by heaven or earth, by thy head, or by <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> Secondly, precepts negative doe <hi>Obligare ad semper,</hi> the Schooles phrase; their tie is straighter then affirmatives. This of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> being such needs no <hi>Omnino,</hi> meanes without it all sorts of lyes: Lye not any lye at any time. For <hi>Omne mendacium</hi> as Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> saith often) all lyes are sinnes. And though <hi>Paul</hi> doe not, the sonne of <hi>Sirak</hi> doth, addes <hi>Omnino</hi> this precept, 7. 14. forbids <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, lye not any lye at all.</p>
            <p>The lye, thats cald <hi>Iocosum,</hi> is not a lye indeede. The speaker ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters it, but the hearer knowes, he meanes not, as hee speakes. Hee speakes not to deceive, but to delight in <hi>hyperbole,</hi> in <hi>allegorie,</hi> or <hi>ironie.</hi> It is <hi>Fictio,</hi> nor <hi>Mendacium.</hi> Who will call <hi>Esops</hi> Fables lyes? It is a Parable, not a lye, that <hi>Iotham</hi> spake to <hi>Gedeons</hi> sonnes, <hi>The trees went forth to annoint a King. Nathans</hi> tale to <hi>David</hi> of the poore mans little Lambe taken from him by the rich man, is no lye, but a similitude. There are some idle fictions of Iesters and parasites made for disport. Their conceipts are <hi>Iocosa,</hi> but they are not <hi>Mandacia;</hi> the hearers laugh at them, but they beleeve them not. But though I say, they are no lyes, I will not say, that they are altogether lawfull. Men doe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in them; I doubt God doth not.</p>
            <p>The third sort of lye we call <hi>Officiosum,</hi> made neither idlely to please, nor maliciously to hurt, but meerely for the good nad safety of my brother. Whether Saint <hi>Paul</hi> prohibit this, many make question: a question Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> calls <hi>Latebrocissimam,</hi> full of unkind cases, odious to answer. If I will not give leave to such a lye, I shall be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with Inhumanitie. I will put some cases briefly. A womans cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitie is assaulted, I can save it by a lye. My neighbours mony is in danger of a Theefe, haply all he hath is in hazzard by a Robber; nay his life sought by an enemy. I can save this by a lye. Shall I be so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>officious, so precise, so hard hearted, to leave her to the ravisher, him to the murtherer, on so poore a scruple of conscience, as a lye? It is haply no sinne in such a case. Say it is; <hi>an non modica est, is it not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle one?</hi> May I not lye thus? I answer, I may not. Nor doe I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:173124:246"/> leave them inhumanely to the perills. I shall intrude else boldly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Gods office: <hi>Salus à Domino,</hi> deliverance is the Lords. I will pray and hope Gods providence will save them. If not, yet I will not sinne against my soule, preferre my neighbours honour, goods, or life, before my soule. The sinne (thou sayst) is little, yet a sinne. The least sinne slaies a soule. Yet haply not this sinne, a lye. Even this, you heard before, <hi>Os quod mentitur, the mouth that lyes,</hi> it <hi>slayes the soule.</hi> Nay Saint <hi>Austine</hi> is austerer yet, puts a case harder. What if my lye may save my neighbours soule? I may not lye for that neither. Nor is the case hard, though it seeme so. For shall I lose my soule, to save my neighbours? That case rather were hard. God bids me love him, but not lose my soule for him. This is Saint <hi>Austins</hi> judgement, the soundest of the Fathers, and all judicious Divines sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe to it. The Schoole maintaines it too.</p>
            <p>The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>esuits sinne the greater, and the Seminarie Priests, who to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape the paine of lawes, lye and forsweare too. Their doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnes lying, as ours doth; yet they use it all. As for Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> prohibition, they presume, they have provided not to trespasse it, by their new invented art of equivocation and mentall reservation; by which they may maintaine the most monstrous lye, that the wit of ma can make.</p>
            <p>Tis time I end this terme. The officious lye is lighter then some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sinne: avoyd it for all that. It hath waight enough in it, to sinke a soule downe unto hell. Art hath given a faire epithet to a foule thing. It is <hi>Officiosum;</hi> but it is <hi>Mendacium.</hi> Thou maist doe an office to thy neighbour by a lye: but it is not the office of a Christian for to lye. Nay theres a Padde too in the word, comes not haply from <hi>Officium,</hi> but from <hi>Officere:</hi> that word meanes mischiefe. Let it meane, as it is taken, my neighbours good: yet I must not lye. I learne of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> that lesson, that I may not doe evill, that good may come of it. Will I rob, to give almes? will I kill my keeper to free my selfe from Iayle? A chast woman, if shee can, will let a lustfull man rather murther her, then ravish her. Be as precise <hi>in veritate,</hi> as thou wouldst be <hi>in castitate,</hi> Saint <hi>Austin</hi> bids. For verity is the soules virginitie. Lyes (saith Saint <hi>Basil</hi>) are the Devills brats. Let not Sathan beget his bastards on thy body. The name of a Precisian is no praise. But God make me worthy to be cald one in this point; not to lye, <hi>Omnino,</hi> any lye, a any time. I have done with it.</p>
            <p>I would not say nothing, though not much of the rest, <hi>one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Invicem.</hi> Two persons in one word, the maker of the lye, and he to whom ts made. Of both joyntly. All lyes are not made <hi>Invicem,</hi> by man to man; some lyes are made to God. <hi>Cains</hi> was, his <hi>Nescio.</hi> Hee answerd God, he knew not where his brother <hi>Abel</hi> was, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming newly from killing him. <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphiraes</hi> was, unto the holy Ghost. So are all falsE answers, and falsE oaths before a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate; he is Gods substitute. My text meanes lyes made but to men, to private men, Lye not one to another. The subject here, being cought, is without note of quantitie, gives the lyar advantage to pleade priviledge: hee is haply excepted. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> meanes not all: hee
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:173124:247"/> does not say, Lye no man to another. The Physitian may, for feare of discomforting his patient; the Lawyer may, for fearie of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging his Client. The Magistrate may in policie, <hi>Plato</hi> sayd, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>Plato,</hi> but a bad divine in that. No man at all may. The subject is generall, though there be no note. All Logitians know that an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definite proposition, <hi>in materia necessaria,</hi> is as an universall. But if the lyar will have needs a note: let him compare this place with the parallell, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 25. Theres <hi>Vnusquisque</hi> expresly. <hi>Speake truth,</hi> (saith Saint <hi>Paul</hi> there) <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>every ma to his neighbour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Surely the Physitian, and the Magistrage much more, especially a King may sometimes suppresse his meaning, any man may. I am not ever bound to tell all truth: but I am ever bound, that all be truth I tell. I may <hi>dissimulare,</hi> dissemble in one sense, <hi>i.</hi> conceale that, which reveald would hurt mee, or my friend. But I may not dissemble, <hi>i.</hi> say that is false, either for my selfe or him. It is not a lye, <hi>cum silendo abscondi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur verum, sed cum loquendo promitur falsum,</hi> when silence conceales something that is true, but thwen speech utters something that is false. And say (if you please) wee may conster <hi>candidè</hi> that speech of the <hi>French</hi> King, <hi>Qui nescit dissimulare, nescit regnare,</hi> hee that cannot keepe counsell is not fit to be a King. But what shall wee doe now for the Seminarie Priest, and the lying Iesuite? I would releeve them too. Heare Loiolite and thy fellow. Wantest thou a Text to license thee to lye? That would bee better then Popes breefe. Looke in the Latin Bible, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 25. Tis no matter for the English, thats he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall: nor for the Greeke, thats corrupt too. The councell of <hi>Trent</hi> htah authorized the Latin, the vulgar Latin so decide all doubts. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> bids thee there <hi>deponere mendacium,</hi> when thou commest to be examined, he bids thee <hi>depose lyes.</hi> Why did not the <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists</hi> translation turne it so?</p>
            <p>As lyes may not bee made by any man; so may they neither bee made to any man: but not to some especially. Not to a Father. <hi>Scelus est parenti proloqui mendacium,</hi> one saith in the Comedie, he is a very wicked sonne, that will lye unto his Father. NOt to a simple man: God will punish thee the more for abusing his credulitie, and the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hurt hee suffers by beleeving thee, the heavier thy judgement will bee for beguiling him. <hi>Cretisa cum Cretensi,</hi> lye to the lyar, if thou wilt needs lye.</p>
            <p>To conclude, beware to be a lyar, lest thou also proove a theefe. The one is so neare of kinne unto the other, that once <hi>Erasmus</hi> sayd, <hi>da mihi mendacem, &amp; ego ostendam tibi furem;</hi> doe thou show mee a a lyar, and ile show thee a theefe. Beloved brethren, I beseech you by Christ Iesus, who calls himselfe the Truth, avoyd this base, this soule-slaying sinne. You that yet have not used it, pray God you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver may. You that have, aske mercy, and never lye againe. The speech was meeke and pious of one of <hi>Iobs</hi> three friends, <hi>If I have done wickedly, I will doe no more.</hi> Will many a meane Christian rather starve then steale? Then will a true <hi>Israelite,</hi> a right <hi>Nathanael</hi> say, I will begge, I will starve, I will rather die then lye. Lye no man to his neighbour: you have heard the paine of lyars. Speak every man the
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:173124:247"/> truth; they shall prosper that love it. It is his promise that is immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, the God that <hi>cannot lye:</hi> who will neither faile nor forsake such as depend on him, but watches to accomplish and make good every <hi>iota</hi> of his word and will, in his good time. And that wee may all doe what the Apostle here injoynes; The God of truth expell the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of lyes out of all hearts; and guide us by his Spirit of truth for Truthes sake, <hi>i.</hi> Christ <hi>Iesus,</hi> to which three sacred persons of the ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Deity be all honour, &amp;c.</p>

            <p>The Persons here Inhibited, are the <hi>Names of Christs Name;</hi> a Phrase not frequent; translated therefore diversly; In the <hi>Geneva</hi> Bibles, the <hi>Callers on Christs name;</hi> that is, by an <hi>Hypallage,</hi> as sundry late learned Expositors doe conster it, those that are named by Christs name, or on whom Christs name is called, surnamed by Christ, <hi>i.</hi> Christians, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors of Christ and his Gospell.

Thou prophane man, if thou feare not God, then name not God. If thou feare him not, as a Sonne his Father; feare him, as a Felon does his Iudge. Name not his wounds; lest the feend wound thee, as he did the Sonnes of <hi>Sceva.</hi> Nor his heart; lest a dart from heaven pierce thy heart, as it did <hi>Iulians.</hi> Nor his Soule; lest Sathan enter thy Soule, as he did <hi>Iudas</hi> his, <hi>and fill thee full of iniquity, and bring thee to destruction both o body and soule.</hi> Thy uncleane mouth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>files his holy name.</p>
            <p>Theres a naming of Christ, lawfull and holy. Tis in Prayer; cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on Christs name, as some of your Bookes have it. For Prayer <hi>must</hi> be in Christs name. [Some prayers have it in the entrance, many in the middes, all in the end.] Christians conclude their Petitions with this close, <hi>through Iesus Christ our Lord.</hi> Some are directly made to Christ. But Christ may not be named so neither by leud men. God bids us pray, call on his name, <hi>Invocame,</hi> saith God.

Keepers of the Law, but of one table onely; have but one God, abhorre Idols, sweare not, sanctifie the Lords day. But if theft, murther, adultery, parents dishonour, and false witnesse bee to bee consterd either by Christs Commentarie, or their owne Catechismes, so loose in all these lawes, that their dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled sanctitie doth but double their iniquitie, and their naming of Christ, is but the shaming of the Gospell.

            <p>In this I know I please not many. Thats all one. I must bee zealous in Gods cause. They often are in idle things; let me be once in serious argument.

[Art thou a Tradesman? and yet why am I so particular? All sorts fault in this folly; let mee speake to all at once.] Thou namest Christ, hearest his word, weekely, daily if thou canst, readest the Scriptures, instructest thy children, and thy servants, prayest with them privately, assiduously. Thou dost well; who but <hi>Ismael</hi> will mocke <hi>Isaac</hi> for these things? But thou that dost these things, wilt thou have in thy shop false waights, false measures, in thy mouth false words, say and lye, protest and leaze; in thy mind false meaning, in thy brest a double heart? Wilt thou defraud, oppresse; promise, but deceive; flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but betray; slander thy brother; be a Woolfe, a Goate, a Lion; a Goate in thy lust, a Woolfe in thy ravage, a Lyon in thy wrath? make conscience of no sinne, so it may bee done in secret?

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE whole Verse containes a Rhetoricall <hi>Dialo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisme,</hi> a supposed Communication betweene two Persons, touching Faith and Workes. Which Figure hath two Parts, <hi>Objectio,</hi> and <hi>Subjectio:</hi> the former pretends Faith, by way of Concession, <hi>Thou hast Faith:</hi> the latter exacts the proofe of it, to be <hi>showed him by his Worke.</hi> The subjection, <hi>i.</hi> the Answer is my Text, consisting of foure termes, the Act, to <hi>Show;</hi> to whom? To <hi>Mee;</hi> the Object, <hi>Faith;</hi> by what? <hi>By Workes. Thou saist thou hast Faith;</hi> Say it not, but <hi>shew</hi> it. Shew it not in secret, but openly to <hi>mee. Show me,</hi> not a fancie, but a <hi>Faith:</hi> no by verball protestation, but by reall evidence, <hi>Show it by thy Workes.</hi> These then are the Points contained in my Text, in number foure: the Proofe, the Iudge, the thing questio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and the Argument. By Gods assistance, and your patience, my purpose is to speake of them, first joyntly of them all, and then se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally of each.</p>
            <p>There is an unkinde controversie betweene the Mother and the Child. Faith is the mother, and Charitie is the child. God hath past a Patent of an honorable office, mans Iustification, and conferd it upon
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:173124:253"/> Faith. The false Petifoggers of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> have foisted in the daughters name, to challenge halves with her. The daughter would disclaime it. For love, who is so kinde, as to part even from her right, for so saith the Apostle, that love seeketh not her owne, cannot be so unnaturall, to encroach upon her Mothers. But her Proctors for their profit doe presse and force it on her. To that purpose they have mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously set <hi>Iames</hi> at jarre with <hi>Paul:</hi> that whereas Saint <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth, that the office of justifying belongs to Faith alone; Saint <hi>Iames</hi> joynes love with Faith; that of <hi>Workes a man is justified, and not by faith alone.</hi> For so he saith expresly at the 24. verse. Diverse of my reverend and very learned brethren have attempted to take up this jarre: but all hath not beene well construed, which I hope hath beene well meant. This Theame my text occasions me to speake unto it too. For it craves a <hi>shew</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> of justifying Faith, a shew <hi>by Workes,</hi> the Show to <hi>me, i.</hi> to men. I thinke, a better Commentary of Saint <hi>Iames</hi> his meaning, that not Faith alone, but Workes doe justifie, cannot be found, than this my Text. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, Faith doth justifie; but he meanes before God; it doth it <hi>apprehensivè.</hi> Saint <hi>Iames</hi> saith, Workes doe justifie; he meanes before man; they doe it <hi>ostensivè,</hi> as the terme is in my Text; they shew, that we are justified. I would not disgrace Workes. I tooke my Text, of purpose to honour them. But I must not wrong the Mother, to doe right unto the child. Faith and Workes I seeke not to sever them: for Christ hath coupled them; But the Question is <hi>Quatenus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Surely Faith justifies alone, without Workes; but the Faith that ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifies, is not alone, nor without Workes. Love ever is with Faith, but it doth not worke with Faith. Love is haply with Faith, even then when it justifies, but she lets her doe that worke alone; she hath neither part nor fellowship in that busines. Christs Manhood at his Passion was not alone; it was united to his deitie; but yet his Manhood suffered alone, his Godhead suffered not. Faith is as fire, and love is as the light. Fire ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is alone without his light; but yet it burnes not by his light. The part of Light is to illuminate, to warme, or to burne, Light hath no skill, nor power. Fire doth them both, but not by it. Fire, as it is <hi>Calidus,</hi> not as it is <hi>Lucidus,</hi> it warmes and burnes by his heat, not by his light. When a gift is offered thee, thou hast not hands alone, but eyes and eares: but yet thou takest, thou receivest the gift, not with thine eares, not with thine eyes, but with thine hands. Pardon of thy sinnes, which is Iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, it is Gods gift; it pleaseth him to proffer and to reach it thee. Faith and Love are both together, either as mother and daughter, or if Papists like not that, as friends and fellowes. Cannot the one bow her selfe to take it, but the other must stoope to; like <hi>Naaman,</hi> and the King of <hi>Syria,</hi> the one cannot worship, but the other must bow too.</p>
            <p>And yet I would the Papists knew, we grant them more than they can prove: it would pose the learnedst of them, to prove love present, when Faith doth justifie. Though Love lets Faith seldome be alone; yet she is not at that Act. Love is but in Faiths wombe, when shee is doing that. Shee is yet unborne, when wee are justified. <hi>Fisher</hi> saith, <hi>Non inficior;</hi> he confesses that Faith justifies, before she bring forth workes; <hi>Cum nondum peperit.</hi> Faith is indeede big with them, <hi>parturiit,</hi>
               <pb n="470" facs="tcp:173124:254"/> saith that Bishop, she was as twere in travell, and ready to bring forth; <hi>Operibus gravida,</hi> very bigge with them; but yet shee justifies us, shee doth that businesse before their birth. Nay they all confesse, and if they did not, Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> would force them, that Workes doe follow Iustification. And lest you should reply, that they may doe so, and yet goe before it; that is denied expresly by that Father, <hi>non prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedunt,</hi> Workes doe not goe before. I say, they confesse, that Workes doe follow justification. But then being asked, what they meane to hold a man justified by Workes? They answer, Iustification is not all at once, but that there is <hi>Actio &amp; Auctio perpetua,</hi> a continuall Act and growth of it in man: and to that (they will stand to it) that Workes are requisite.</p>
            <p>Well, because they are so resolute, we will yeeld them that: for they thinke, they have Scripture for it: <hi>Qui justus est, justificetur adhuc; hee that is just, let him be justified yet.</hi> But this is Sophistrie; for that Iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation meanes Sanctification. They dispute not <hi>adidem.</hi> They catch at a Scripture, where they find the word, but in another sense. To which purpose they have cunningly devised a Distinction, of first and second Iustification; by which when wee reprove their righteousnesse by Workes, that they soloecise in saying that Workes doe justifie; they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to delude us by that bald distinction of second justification. A Iesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iticall tricke; for that Iustification is a meere equivocation; an answer of Onions to a question of Leekes. The question betweene us and them, is whether Faith alone doe justifie; and we meane by justifying, the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitting us of sinne. We say, Faith doth it only; they will have Workes too. But when we joyne issue, they runne to boyes play at <hi>Primus, secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> to a second Act of Iustification, quite of another meaning; a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse in holinesse, which is nothing to the point. For so themselves define it, even the fiercest of them all, that the first Act of Iustification, is by which a man of wicked is made just, and that is just our sense; the second by which, of being just already, he is made more just; which is (as they say truely) profiting in righteousnesse. They know our meaning is in the first sense. What a trifling is this, to seeme to oppose to us, and to presse us with the second?</p>
            <p>I see nothing for my part, but a meere <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a wrangling about words; and a folly to follow them, who so cowardly flie off. Nay what neede we further strife? When wee have (to my seeming) <hi>Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentem reum,</hi> even their <hi>Atlas,</hi> their <hi>Goliah</hi> grants what we can aske: that <hi>Paul</hi> meanes, and meanes it well, that a man is justified by Faith without Works; and that that Iustification, which is in S. <hi>Iames,</hi> which is by Workes, is of another sort, and in another sense. Let mine, my learned brethren, if you thinke it right, be the last lost labour in this idle controversie.</p>
            <p>Yet am I (as little as I love the Papists) a Papist in this; I thinke it good discretion, and great need, in these prophane and irreligious times, to preach for workes, rather then for faith. For saith not the Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, contraries are cured by contraries? and doe not their practitioners according to that rule, fit the remedy ever to the maladie? Very excellent things are spoken of thee, O thou rich grace
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:173124:254"/> of God, the securer from sinne, the deliverer from death, the chaser of Sathan, the pleaser of God. Her hands lay hold on Christ, and her eyes behold Gods face. Let his tongue cleave to the roofe of his mouth that disgraceth that disparageth, that preferres not faith. But Gods faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Steward must also be wise, to distribute to all that are of his house; their <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, their portion in their time: to the servant, to the sonne, to the yong, to the old, to the slow, to the active, to the sicke, to the whole, to every one, <hi>demensum suum in tempore suo,</hi> their due portion in their due season. There is a time to plant, and a time to plucke up; a time to build, and a time to breake downe. Faith is Gods plant: my meaning is not, it should be puld up. But Sathan the supplanter hath set in many soules a false semblant of true faith; that would be puld up. Faith is Gods building; my meaning is not, it should be broke downe. But the devil by art magicke hath reard in many hearts a fantasticke fabricke of a feigned faith; a fansie, not a faith, and that would be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molished.</p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, Faith justifies; and it onely does it, faith without workes; and he saith true. And Saint <hi>Iames</hi> saith, workes justifie, faith onely does it not, and he saith true too. This haply seemes strange to you, two propositions contradictory true. No mervaile, if <hi>Luther</hi> (if Papists belye him not) cald this Epistle <hi>stramineam Epistolam,</hi> that hath in it such strawne, such stubble divinity. Mervell not beloved; there is no contradiction. For in a contradiction, the opposition is <hi>ad idem:</hi> the termes must hold one sense, both in the positive, and the negative. So they doe not here. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> meanes a true faith; Saint <hi>James</hi> meanes a counterfeit. With <hi>Paul</hi> to justifie, is to acquit of sinne; with <hi>Iames,</hi> to show to men, that one is just. Whether <hi>Luther,</hi> or no, cald it a strawne epistle, I wonder learned Papists should so stumble at a straw. For that Saint <hi>Iames</hi> meanes so, my Text gives a testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, show mee thy faith, saith hee, show it by thy workes. Workes justifie <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, declaratively, they show a man is just.</p>
            <p>This Righteousnesse of workes, Saint <hi>Iames</hi> justification, if it be po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, I must crave pardon to teach it at this time. These times doe call for it: these times, in which not onely love is waxen cold, but frozen quite to death. And certainely Faith lives not after Love. Faith is Loves Mother; and as <hi>Iudah</hi> said to <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Benjamin</hi> so may I of these, the Soule of the Mother, hangeth on the Soule of the Child. Our Apostle saith that too, at the last verse of this Chapter, that Faith is dead. Where there are not workes, which are the acts of Love, and ever come from it, while it hath life; there faith is dead. Where workes are not, Faith lives not. Faith is but a pretence, to protect pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanenesse and hypocrisie. Faith is a shield: the Apostle cals it so, the shield of faith. It is a shield; and sin lookes for shelter under that shield: a cloake to shroud iniquity.</p>
            <p>The Sect of Libertines began but lately, but in our fathers daies. But as your Lecturer hath told you lately, that vipers soone multiply into generations; so is their spawne disparcled over all lands. <hi>Islebs</hi> posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are not so knowne perchance, as <hi>Islebs</hi> toombe, not knowne by
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:173124:255"/> reading. But the devill hath infused them by secret instinct into the hearts of multitudes, almost of all. They beare themselves upon the Gospell; it makes man just; <hi>&amp; Lex non est justo posita, the just man hath not to doe with the Law.</hi> He hath learnd of <hi>Luther,</hi> that which <hi>Luther</hi> never meant, <hi>doctrina operum, doctrina daemonum,</hi> the doctrine of workes is the doctrine of devils. The seed of that leud schisme was sowne first in <hi>Germany;</hi> but belike it is blowne over the Sea, and flowne into this land. Shall I cite you some of their impious positions? The Law is not worthy to be cald Gods word. Meddle not with <hi>Moses:</hi> hee leads thee straight unto the devill. Make sure your vocation (saith Saint <hi>Peter</hi>) by good workes? Alas poore man, say they, he conceived not Christian liberty. The Law belongs to the Courts, not to the Pulpit. Christians must so live, that Iewes and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, and all wicked men, may be the more offended at our evill acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The teacher of good workes to bee needfull to Salvation, is a double Papist, a Pelagian, and Apostata; Nay <hi>Nicolaus Amsdorfius</hi> said they were pernitious unto Salvation. Take these but for a taste: there is no raking long in such a stinking puddle. God forbid our people should be so impudent, to proclaime such leud positions openly. But looke into our lives; and our Actions will accuse us, that what they write, wee thinke. We say, as much as they; but wee say it in our hearts; more bashfull then they, but not lesse sinnefull then they. I detaine you too long in the generality; it is time to come now to each point in particular.</p>
            <p>The first, I propounded was the proofe, <hi>show me,</hi> saith the Apostle. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Faith is no fellon, that she should flye sight; not deformed, or evill-favoured, to shunne the eye. Love should not be her daughter, dared shee not be seene. Love it selfe likes not to lie unknowne; and her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loves not to lurke unseene. Faith lurkes not, nor shee lazes not. Her owne hands worke; and she suffers not her daughters to be idle. Like the thrifty huswife in the <hi>Proverbes,</hi> her hands are on the wherne, and her fingers on the distaffe. Christs sufferings are the wherne, and his righteousnesse the distaffe. Shee rubs the spindle on her thigh, and shee drawes the thread out toward her. Christs sufferings and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, Faith holds and handles, and applies them unto us. Shee twists and shee spinnes us a robe out of his righteousnesse. And Charity her daughter workes as hard as shee. Shee embroiders with the needle; her tent is holinesse, and her worke is all on that; shee onely tends that taske, and with her mothers worke shee meddles not. The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers eye is still upon the daughter, that shee doe not play. Like a strict <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, shee holds her to her worke, all the day, every day; shee rests not on the Sabbath. The idle, according to the proverbe in <hi>Theocritus,</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, like loitering schollars in some schooles, they play every day, and whole daies, <hi>Rem magnam prestas,</hi> it is a wonder if ever such proove learned. But Faith keepes no holidayes, but labors all her life, Sabbath dayes and all.</p>
            <p>Faith (I confesse indeed) appeares not in her person: vertue is invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible. But as God was seene to <hi>Moses,</hi> so is shee to men, <hi>per posterio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> onely by her backe parts, which are workes. They faile not where
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:173124:255"/> shee is; but follow faith inseparably. As where there is no light, you may safely say, there is no sunne: so where workes are not, you may conclude peremptorily, there is no faith. <hi>Eliseus</hi> servant said of the <hi>Shunammites</hi> son, when he saw, there was neither <hi>vox</hi> nor <hi>auditio,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther speech, nor sense, that the child was not awake. The fellow was too fine, he might have said, the child lived not. Workes are the breath of Faith, our Apostle makes them so, <hi>ver. vlt.</hi> they are the pulse of Faith; the two <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the proofes, by which we may judge, whether it live. If you feele them not; the Faith is ghostlesse. Say not, that Faith sleepeth, for finenesse of phrase; say plainely, shee is dead: for Saint <hi>Iames</hi> saith so. I would not now unwarily reason for the Papist; thats one thing he would have, that there is a dead faith; hee holds a true faith may be dead. But by a dead faith, we meane a feigned faith, which is no faith at all. Where there are no workes, there is no faith; not a dead faith onely, but no faith at all. Let them not instance in hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storicall faith, or the faith of miracles; they both are equivocall, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to this purpose. Those faiths may be showne without good works: for the devils have one of them, and <hi>Iudas</hi> had them both. But the Faith we meane, is not showne, but by workes.</p>
            <p>I doe not say, Love is the life of Faith, or it is the soule of Faith. Such hyperbolicall tropes I dare not venture on. But I doe say, love is the pulse of Faith, it argues Faith to have both life and soule. The last verse of this Chapter hath stumbled the Papists, that because Saint <hi>Iames</hi> saith there, <hi>as the body without the Spirit, is dead; so Faith without workes is dead;</hi> therefore workes are the Spirit of Faith, and so the Soule of Faith. Why may I not translate it, as the body without breath is dead; so is Faith without workes. And let them then in Gods name make workes the breath of Faith. Breathing is an argument of life in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and so are workes of faith in the Soule. I will not be peremptory; some may be my teachers, that are my hearers. But I have good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours, that the word will beare that Sense. Whether it doe there or no, I leave it to the learned. Workes are not <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, not the life, but the breath of Faith. Faith hath not <hi>esse &amp; vivere,</hi> but it hath <hi>movere,</hi> it lives not by Love, but it mooves by it; it mooves and breathes by it. Thou choakest and smotherest him, whose breath thou stoppest. Faith needes must breath, and her breath are workes. If thou stop them; thou stiflest and thou stranglest Faith.</p>
            <p>To end this, the Scriptures, the Fathers, the Philosophers resemble Love to fire. So may I Faith, as fitly. The heat of fire will not be hid; and the zeale of Faith will not be smothered: but fire will burst forth in flames, and Faith will sparkle forth in Workes. It is but equall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that the Apostle askes; if any man say, he hath Faith; let him shew it.</p>
            <p>The next point is the Person, that must Iudge. Hast thou Faith? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> thou saiest it. Who shall judge? Not thy selfe, thou wilt be partiall; <hi>Show it me.</hi> It is a <hi>Synecdoche; to me,</hi> that is, to men, show thy faith to others, show it to the world. <hi>Sciretuum nihil est.</hi> Thou art sure, thou hast faith; but it is good to have a witnesse. Thou wilt say thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science knoweth it; and it is a thousand witnesses. But Saint <hi>Paul</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:173124:256"/> the testimony of those that are without: not only with out thee, to show thy faith to thy brethren in the faith; but without the Church also, to infidels too, if thou be occasioned. As for the Proverbe, it meanes an evill Conscience, not a good; and the witnesse of it, not for thee, but against thee. The Conscience so, is indeed a thousand wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses. And haply thy Conscience belyeth thee: for it is sometimes er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous, not <hi>Conscientia</hi> but <hi>Inscientia.</hi> Then may it tell thee, thou hast Faith, when thou hast none. Suspect thy Conscience, when it sooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thee. But haply thou belyest thy Conscience: thou saiest, it knowes that thou hast faith; when it saith secretly, tongue thou liest. If thou have faith indeed; have it <hi>teste coelo,</hi> as he saith in the tragedy; show it openly, that the world may witnesse it; make me beleeve, that thou beleevest.</p>
            <p>But thou wilt say, that men are lyers too. <hi>David</hi> saith it, <hi>Omnis ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo mendax, all men are lyers.</hi> Let God be Iudge, I will show my Faith to him. First, <hi>Davids</hi> speech was in his passion: <hi>I said in my haste, All men are lyers.</hi> Secondly, thy lothnesse to be judged by men, is a shrewd presumption, that thou hast not faith. For if thou hadst, thou hast Love too; which if thou hast, thou wouldst not be suspicious; for Love is not. Wouldst thou be judged by God? <hi>Vox Populi, Vox Dei,</hi> the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples verdict is the voice of God. I, and another, and a third may erre: but what all men judge of thee, that live with thee, is lightly true. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, because thou wilt needs be judged by God. I will say to thee, as <hi>Festus</hi> said to <hi>Paul, hast thou appeald to Caesar? unto Caesar shalt thou goe:</hi> hast thou appeald to God? to God therefore shalt thou goe; and thou shalt not goe farre neither. Remoove but two verses from my Text; there shalt thou heare Gods Iudgement, both of thy selfe, vaine man; and of thy faith, that it is dead. And vaine thou art indeed, who when the Apostle craves a tryall of thy faith by thy conversation, thinkest to avoide it by vaine tergiversation, by appealing unto God. Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> nay, God, for from his spirit he speakes, will have thy faith be showne, <hi>Ostende fidem tuam,</hi> not knowne to God, but showne to men. God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the knower of the heart, needeth not our showing him our faith. Spare to spend thy paines, where it is superfluous, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow it where thou shouldest, where Saint <hi>Iames</hi> biddeth, <hi>Show thy faith to me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To <hi>me?</hi> why so? As the Hebrewes sayd to <hi>Moses,</hi> thou wilt haply say to me, <hi>Quis te constituit judicem,</hi> who made you my judge, that you should examine me? Indeed no man hath to doe to judge anothers ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant: he stands or falls to his owne master. But why vantest thou of thy faith to me? Haply thou hast faith. But if thou wouldst, that I should thinke, thou hast, thou must show it me. Besides doth not the Apostle bid us to be ready to give a reason of our faith, every man to every man. No reason is so kind, as workes, for it is reall; and if to every man, then also unto me.</p>
            <p>Yet why to me? there are men enough besides to see my faith. <hi>Quid mihi et tibi,</hi> as Christ sayd to his mother, what have you to do with me? surely I have. Thy workes should show me light to glorifie God. Thy workes should also show mee what thou art, <hi>albus an ater,</hi> a sheepe, or
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:173124:256"/> a wolfe: that if thou be a sheepe, I may feed with thee; but if a wolfe, I may beware of thee. It skills God, it skills mee, that thou show thy selfe by workes. God for his glory, mee for my safety. To end this, every one whom Christ hath cald, must doe his best to bring his brother to Christ too, as <hi>Andrew</hi> did <hi>Peter,</hi> and as <hi>Philip</hi> did <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanael.</hi> The fruits of thy faith must draw others to the faith; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou must show it mee. <hi>Nascitur indignè, per quem &amp;c.</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
            </p>
            <p>The third point is the object, the thing in question, it is <hi>Faith;</hi> what Faith? for faith is manifold. There is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a faith of miracles; it is not that. For it (Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith) hath not love, and <hi>Iudas</hi> had it, a damned reprobate, and there is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, an historicall faith; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it that. For King <hi>Agrippa</hi> beleeved the Prophets, and <hi>Herod</hi> beleeved <hi>Iohn;</hi> and all Christians, Libertines &amp; all beleeve the Scripturs. Even the Devills have this Faith. But it is the Faith that justifies, that engrafts thee into Christ, that reconciles thee unto God, that quits thy sinne, and saves thy soule.</p>
            <p>I doubt the Papists do meane the faith of Miracles. What mean they else to make such account of them, to make such adoe with them? Yet surely they doe not: they are learned and judicious, and cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster the Apostle so. And yet surely they doe: for else why doe they make the working of wonders one note of the Church? Meane what faith they will, they meane amisse; they cannot meane Saint <hi>Iames</hi> his justifying faith. For <hi>Iudas</hi> wrought miracles; so doth Antichrist; so doth the Devill. But of all faiths, I would wish them to beware of the faith of wonders; wonders in these dayes are the note of Antichrist. Their age is out; they fitted the infancie of the Church; faith is <hi>adulta</hi> now, and needs them not. Gods Oracles suffice us; we expect not Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles. The Papists insult over us, because they have them, and wee not. Our Faith being the antient and apostolicke Faith, had miracles long since, it needs none now. Miracles are for the first founding, not the continuall feeding of the faith. If they will bethinke them, they cannot worse disgrace, they cannot more foulely disable their faith, then by working of miracles; for they show, that their Religion is a new Faith. Boast not proud Papist, that thy Church is a wonder-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker: for that glory is thy shame.</p>
            <p>It is not then the faith of Miracles, not historicall faith, that must be showne, but a justifying faith: All the aime of the Apostle is direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at that marke. For that is the faith that thou vauntest and boastest of. Not that thou confessest Christ, or workest wonders in his name; but that thou beleevest on him: that thy sinne and thy paine are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned thorough him, and that thou shalt bee saved by him. Not thy bare assent to the story of the Gospell, that it is true; but they hearty embracing of the grace of the Gospell, to apply it to thy selfe; thy apprehension of Christ and his Crosse, and his whole obedience, the application of his righteousnesse to thee, and the undoubted expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of eternall life.</p>
            <p>There yet remaines the mainest point, the Argument; by which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> the faith is proved; and that is <hi>workes.</hi> Works are the tokens and try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of Faith. <hi>Probatio Amoris, exhibitio Operis,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Gregory.</hi> The
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:173124:257"/> showing of love, is the doing of workes; and love is but faiths instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Thou pretendest to have Faith; and they say, love is faiths soule. It must therefore be in Faith, or it is dead. If love be there, why works it not? It is not faith, tis but <hi>Cadaver,</hi> saith S. <hi>Bernard,</hi> Faiths corpes: too fine a name for so course a thing: faiths carcasse; too good yet. He saith not <hi>Corpus,</hi> but <hi>Cadaver;</hi> a barren faith, it is a carren faith. Love is faiths life Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> saith, and love loves to labour, not to laze.</p>
            <p>What? saith some Papist, say me that againe, love is faiths life, saith <hi>Ber.</hi> condemnd you not that phrase before? Loe you now, as God would have it, your selfe doe cite it out of a Father. Soft rash insulter. I cite it, and he saith it; and I say more, he saith it well, because he meanes it well. For he explaines his meaning, where he saith it, <hi>Fidei vitam opera at te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantur.</hi> He saith, love is faiths life; that is, the works of love do witnesse that faith lives. It showes faiths life, it doth not give faith life. And yet S. <hi>Bernard</hi> was a man of your Church too.</p>
            <p>Faith must be showne by works, that men may <hi>judicare,</hi> judge of faith; works must be <hi>indicare,</hi> show the faith. Love is <hi>Index fidei,</hi> the touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone of faith. Lay faith to love; if it will not hold the touch, it is a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit. A distastfull doctrine to licentious men: the libertine likes it not. His Catechisme has the beleefe, but not the Decalogue. He objects out of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> that we are not <hi>sub lege,</hi> but <hi>sub gratia, not under the Law, but under Grace.</hi> But S. <hi>August.</hi> answers him; we are not <hi>sub lege,</hi> but yet we are <hi>In lege;</hi> we are within the Law, like subjects, though not under it, like slaves. And the right Christian Catechisme joynes the ten Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments close unto the Creede. We live now in a talking, not in a walking age: men are speakers, not workers. And indeed there is a showing of a thing by words, and the false faith-faigner faine would have that: as if in my Text, <hi>ostendere,</hi> were <hi>os tendere,</hi> to stretch the jawes, that faith should be showed by straining of the mouth; by strong protestations. But S. <hi>Iames</hi> saith not <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>show me thy faith,</hi> by speech but <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, not by words, but <hi>by workes.</hi> It is not <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

            <p>If words might be credited, no man would want faith. <hi>Abraham</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiled the <hi>Father of the faithfull,</hi> should need to have his name changed once againe; he would have so many sonnes. Every man would take up the blind mans cry to Christ, <hi>Lord I beleeve.</hi> What mouth would not make one lye for his master. But it is <hi>Ostensio,</hi> not <hi>Ostentatio,</hi> not a show of words, but a reall proofe. Sayst thou, that thou hast faith? <hi>Quid ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba audiam? facta vidiam.</hi> Let me not heare my faith, but see it. Sight is the surer sense: a slie dissembler may deceive that too; but yet not so soone, not so easily as the hearing. The eye doth best describe deceit; the best spier of falsehood, the best tryer of truth. <hi>Nisi videro, &amp; misero,</hi> saith <hi>Thomas</hi> of Christs rising; so unlesse I see and feele thy faith, I will not beleeve. Works make faith visible, they make it palpable; except where the hypocrite is very artificiall. There may be workes, where there is no faith: there may haply be workes, where faith is not; but there is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly no faith, where workes are not. Workes are but a <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, an infallible Demonstration. But it is the best man hath; and the Apostle craves but it.</p>
            <p>Live well, doe the workes of pietie, of charitie, of peace, of justice, of holinesse, of lowlinesse, of sobernesse and truth; and tell me, thou hast faith; though thou lye; I will beleeve thee. Deceive me so; I will not censure thee. But if thou <hi>robbe</hi> Gods selfe by Idolatrie, <hi>abuse</hi> Gods name by blasphemie, <hi>prophane</hi> Gods holy day, <hi>defraud</hi> Gods Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters; his house, by sacriledge, by fraud; make no conscience of blood, of whoredome, of drunkennesse, of usurie, of briberie, of oppression, of extortion, of doing any wrong, either violently of fraudulently: I will say, thou hast no faith: for the faithfull flee these things. <hi>Malè credit, quicunque peccat,</hi> saith <hi>Origen,</hi> it is a sorie faith, that serveth sinne. Love (thou wilt say) is not suspicious, nor thinketh evill; but neither is it simple, to be perswaded against sense.</p>
            <p>Nay say thou sinne not in this sort, at leastwise not in sight; yet if thou doe not good, all the good thou canst, in every worke of mercy, of godlinesse, and right; and say that thou hast faith: I will say, I see it not. Love hopeth the best, and beleeveth all things; and so will I. I will hope thou mayst have faith haply hereafter; I will beleeve, thou mayst beleeve in time; but thy faith as yet is dead. [Dead faith, thou wilt reply on me? thats something yet: dead faith is faith: nay dead faith is true faith. <hi>Hoc aliquid nihil est,</hi> the something is just nothing. That dead faith is true faith, who saith it, but the Papist? Hee may say as well, a dead man is a true man. One Father is of worth to waigh downe a world of them: <hi>Didymus</hi> is he; <hi>Fides mortua, fides nulla,</hi> a dead faith (saith he) is no faith.]</p>
            <p>The Romanists would show us their faith by miracles: a show (with their favours) fabulous and frivolous. Fabulous, for they are lyes, either <hi>figmenta mendacium hominum,</hi> or <hi>portenta fallacium daemonum,</hi> as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith. A right show indeede, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any substance or semblance of truth. I cannot speake of them more basely, then some of themselves. And frivolous; for first, the consequent is naught, wonders may bee wrought, and have beene by the faithlesse. The grace of Miracles is <hi>gratis data,</hi> not <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum faciens,</hi> it is given even to Reprobates. Secondly beside the point. Faith must bee showed, not by wonders, but by workes. As though (they will reply) that wonders were not workes. Indeede they are, and Christ often calls them so. But the workes meant in my Text, are not <hi>Potestatis,</hi> but <hi>Sanctitatis,</hi> the workes of righteousnesse and holinesse. Looke what kind of faith is meant, that kind of workes is meant. Saint <hi>Iames</hi> his theme is of the faith of righteousnesse: the workes to show it must therefore bee of righteousnesse. Iustifying faith to bee showed by wonders, that were a wonder. Then no man should be justified, but hee that could worke miracles. No wonder, no faith: no faith, no righteousnesse; no righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse no life. God forbid.</p>
            <p>To conclude, faire is Faiths face; but love is her looking glasse: works the onely mirrour which man may see her in. Had God made man, a
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:173124:258"/>
               <hi>Momus</hi> would in <hi>Lucian,</hi> with a brest of glasse: men might have seene our faith without good works. The brest being transparent, the heart had beene open to the eye. But Faith being invisible, and hidden in the heart, needs outward evidence to prove her there. That evidence is workes: Workes Faiths witnesses, her touchstone and her glasse; the flowers and fruits of Faith; the sparkles and the beames of it; the breath and pulse, and if you please, the life of Faith. Which the Lord of life vouchsafe to breath into us by his Spirit; unto both which blessed persons of the sacred Godhead, together with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, bee duly ascribed all honour, majestie, power and thankesgiving <hi>in secula.</hi>

Sinne might have made the fifth; it deserves it more than they. They are indeede all
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:173124:259"/> foure, unsatiable things: but sinne exceedes them. The sea is an unruly creature; yet God hath shut it up with doores, <hi>Iob</hi> saith: hath said to it, Hitherto thou shalt come, but no further. Lust will not be confin'd, still presseth on, and cries <hi>Plus ultrà.</hi> Sinne is the Horse in the <hi>Revel.</hi> 6. 8. free enough of it selfe, too free. Yet he hath a Rider too, and a Follower besides; one upon him to spurre him, it is Death; an other behind him, to Goade him, it is Hell. On he will, on he must: hee must needes goe, whom the devill drives. Not Drives onely, but Drawes too. Sinne hath cords, to hall men towards hell, <hi>Funes peccati, Prov.</hi> 5. 22. not <hi>Funiculos,</hi> little cords, such as were on Christs scourge, <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. 15. but <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

            <p>Sinne hath no <hi>Sufficit,</hi> no sinne: Instance in Avarice. The Covetous mans wealth, corraded by Corruption, Extortion, Oppression, this yeare, and the last, gives it him content? It rather gives him appetite to raven more the next yeare, than the last. As Fame, <hi>Crescit eundo,</hi> as it goes, still it growes: so is this Lust, the longer the stronger: That as Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> notes of it, when a man doth <hi>Senescere,</hi> waxe old, it doth then <hi>Iuvenescere,</hi> wax young: It is most Active, when we are in age. Instance in wanton lust. Though <hi>David</hi> had store of wives of his owne, besides Concubines: yet they suffice not; he sees <hi>Vriahs</hi> wife, and must have her. Time laies not lust, allayes it not: but it growes greater rather to morrow than to day. Indeed to morrow should be to dayes disciple, the Gnomicall Poet saith; our sinne <hi>this</hi> day, should teach us to be shie of it the next. But it is so sweet; it increaseth the lust rather. Many are often wearie of <hi>well</hi> doing; who ere of ill? The baites of sinne are deare to sinners; dearely bought, but dearely loved. One will part with his soule, as soone as with his sinne: nay from his soule the sooner of the two. How else hath hell come by so many soules, had not sinne seemed to man more precious, than they? Man will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther burne in hell, than coole in lust. What a desperate speech is that of the drunkards in the Prophet, <hi>Cras sicut hodic, to morrow shall be as to day,</hi> yea worse, farre worse than it. Nay indeed every sinne once growne to habite, inebriates the lust, makes it thirst more and more, and cry with another of that trade too in the Proverbs, <hi>Pergam, requiram ampliùs,</hi> so soone, as I am up, I will doe, as I did yesterday.</p>
            <p>Besotted sinner, be not too precipitate; the Race thou runnest in, ends in hell. Make not Profession to proceede, Profession of progression in iniquitie, Thou art farre enough already. Goe not too farre thither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, whence there is no returne. <hi>Invius retrò lacus</hi> never came any back from hell. Some say, one did, <hi>Trajan</hi> the Emperour: but at the great importunitie of the Pope; and he shent for it too. Some have returned from heaven: <hi>Moses</hi> did, and <hi>Elias</hi> at Christs Transfiguration. Yea many of the Saints did at Christs Passion: but not any out of hell. It is the Harlots house, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2. 19. they never come out, that once goe in: and the Note there too is universall, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

            <pb n="481" facs="tcp:173124:259"/>
            <p>There was a <hi>Preacher</hi> once gave a young man counsell to walke on in his lusts, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 11. 9. Nay there was an Angell once, that said unto the sinner, <hi>Qui sordescit, sordescat adhuc; he that is filthy, let him be so still, Apoc.</hi> 22. But neither Men nor Angells must be heard in this: heare Saint <hi>Peter</hi> before both; he cries <hi>Sufficit</hi> to the Iewes, let it suffice them to have lived loosely hithertoo. Neither yet mistake the Preacher; he spake not in sad sooth. Nor misconster not the Angell; his meaning was Propheticall: not to show men, what they should doe, but to fore-show them, what they would doe. What both of them thought seriously of living still in sinne, is plaine by that which followes: But know (saith the Preacher) that the Lord for this will bring thee unto judgement: and, Behold (saith the Angell) Christ shortly comes with his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
            <p>The voyce of all the Prophets and Apostles at all times hath beene the same with Saint <hi>Peters</hi> here, to cease from sinne. <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> before Christ, all the Prophets before him, every one cried to the people of his time, <hi>Convertimini, &amp; Resipiscite, Turneye</hi> and <hi>repent. Moses</hi> hath his <hi>Non ampliùs,</hi> see that your neckes be not hardened any more. <hi>Micha</hi> hath his <hi>Non ultrà,</hi> See you commit adultery no more. And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> hath it too, <hi>Ne serviamus ultrà,</hi> let us serve sinne no more. Nay Christ himselfe saith the very same, both to the Lazar of <hi>Bethesda,</hi> and to the Adulteresse woman, <hi>Noli peccare ampliùs;</hi> Sinne not any more. <hi>Iesus</hi> Gods Sonne said it twice: <hi>Iesus Sirachs</hi> sonne said it once too, My sonne, hast thou sinned? Doe thou so no more. To continuance in sinne, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> gives an <hi>absit, a God-forbid</hi> to that. An heathen could say, that to erre, was <hi>Humanum,</hi> but to persevere, <hi>Belluinum,</hi> to sinne, humane weakenesse; but to persist, willfull wickednesse.</p>
            <p>To end this <hi>Epoche,</hi> lust is full loath to lose her libertie, to be restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Yea where the Sprit is willing; yet even there the Flesh is weake. <hi>Da mihi Castitatem,</hi> give me the grace of continencie, twas Saint <hi>Austins</hi> prayer; <hi>sed noli modò,</hi> but give it me not yet. He was loath to leave his sinne too soone. He prayed; but could have wisht, God would not heare him; prayed in feare. Faine would he weane his lust from sinne: but his resolution was <hi>Lenta, &amp; somnolenta,</hi> his owne termes, lazie and drousie, <hi>Modò, ecce modò sine paululùm.</hi> Like the <hi>Levites</hi> Father in law, <hi>Iud. 19. I pray thee stay a little: first eate a morsell, and goe then.</hi> Yet stay to night, and to morrow thou shalt goe. To morrow being come; yet one day more. That past too; yet tarrie, and dine. That done; yet tis now Sunne-goe-to: stay but this night, and to morrow thou shalt goe. So hath lust twenty delayes, still procrastinates, makes many mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, loath to depart.

Now they are <hi>Adulti</hi> in the Gospell: that age <hi>alios mores postulat,</hi> craves another course of life. They had beene bad trees before, and borne like fruites; wild vines, and brought soure grapes.

            </p>
            <p>Their former conversation was the Old Man. Him they had put off in Baptisme, and put on the New. They must therefore walke thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth in righteousnesse, and true holinesse.

               <hi>Clemens</hi> cites out of <hi>Euripides,</hi> shall <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> serve <hi>Barbarians,</hi> Christians serve sinne? Yea it seemes to him ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd: <hi>How shall wee</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>that are dead to sinne, live in it any longer?</hi> The Project of Baptisme is Repentance: and a Christians life should be <hi>Baptismo consona,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Austin,</hi> answerable to his Baptisme. There he bound himselfe from sinne: hee may not now persist in it. <hi>Sine illum,</hi> let him alone yet, till he be baptised; so they would say in Saint <hi>Austins</hi> time. But being once baptised, hee had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Christs Presse-money: he must now defie the Flesh, and fight ever after under Christs ensigne. Els if Christ shall have his name, but sinne his service; he is (as Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> termes him) <hi>Christianus An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristianus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Surely Saint <hi>Peter</hi> is very moderate. Saith he, but tis <hi>Enough?</hi> It is too much to have served sinne hitherto. What hath the devill done for us? Wee doe not owe him one dayes service: why have we served him so long? Well yet leave him at last, and let us serve the Lord hereafter. God craves our service all our lives. Hath he not cause? <hi>Exigit te, qui fecit te,</hi> Well may he claime us that hath made us. To <hi>Cujus sum,</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> joynes <hi>Cui servio;</hi> tis fit, we serve him, whose we are; serve him e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, from the cradle, from the breasts. We have been Fugitives all this while: let us henceforth at least serve him. Saint <hi>Peters</hi> request is very reasonable. We have served Sathan all the day: let us offer our Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Sacrifice to God. We have lodged with him, broke our fast, and
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:173124:260"/> dined with him; <hi>Apud superos Caenabimus,</hi> let us suppe yet with our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. To be short in this; a child may speak, understand, think, as a child, but when he becomes a man, it becomes him to leave childishnesse. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> prayed pardon for the sins of his youth; desired not Indulgence to retaine them in his Age; askt forgivenesse for Old, not libertie for New.</p>
            <p>Now be this our lesson: tis no shame for Christians to learne with Iewes. The Pronoune opportunes us. Some Copies have <hi>vobis;</hi> but the most and best, have <hi>Nobis,</hi> the first person; Saint <hi>Peter</hi> speakes to us.

               </gap>, said, it was then too late. Stand at the Preachers <hi>Sufficit;</hi> sinne no more, but repent. Repent this day, this houre.

            <p>Heare also his Argument. The time past of our lives hath beene past in sensuality. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, Adulterers, Theeves, Drunkards, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortioners, shall not come in Heaven. I will not adde with him, that some of you were such. That were dangerous for me to say, but more for you to be. Surely, I may say truely and safely, that Saint <hi>Iames</hi> saith, <hi>In multis omnes offendimus,</hi> not Some of us, but All, not in some things, but in Many, <hi>In many things we offend All.</hi> Answer Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> every one, as <hi>Elihu</hi> saith in <hi>Iob.</hi> tis a godly resolution, <hi>If I have done wickedly, I will doe no more.</hi> A shame for these Iewes, more shame for us Christians to persist in sinne. For it is <hi>Voluntas gentium,</hi> the <hi>Lust of the Gentiles:</hi> Sinne is but Heathenisme; that is the other Argument, and the last thing in my Text.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>After the lust of the Gentiles:</hi> First it is their <hi>Lust;</hi> not their Law, but their Lust, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, their Will. There were good lawes even among Heathens, morall lawes. Had the Iewes lived after <hi>them,</hi> they had had some Apologie against the Apostle. Though God gave <hi>Israel</hi> Lawes, and they were to looke at <hi>them,</hi> not at the Gentiles: yet even the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens Lawes, had they lookt but at <hi>them,</hi> would have excused them at least <hi>de tanto.</hi> Many very excellent. One would almost thinke them Transcripts of Scripture. And what is <hi>Plato</hi> but <hi>Moses Atticissans,</hi> a meere <hi>Moses</hi> in another dialect? But the Iewes listed not to line their lives by any lawes; to live <hi>Legibus,</hi> but <hi>Exemplis,</hi> not after the Lawes, but the lusts of the Gentiles. The Heathens but bad authours for them to imitate, but specially in their lusts.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Saint <hi>Peter</hi> to set upon their sinne greater disgrace yet, cals it the <hi>Will,</hi> or the <hi>Lust</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> A base thing for a <hi>Iew</hi> to imitate a <hi>Gentile.</hi> It was a glory to the <hi>Iewes,</hi> to be stild <hi>the Circumcision.</hi> They would call the <hi>Philistins</hi> in disdaine, uncircumcised. They were <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the <hi>Circumcision.</hi> But sinne uncircumcised them, turned them (Saint
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:173124:261"/> S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith) into <hi>Praeputium, Rom. 2. 25. Israel</hi> for their Idolatry are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Gentiles, 2 King. 17. 33. ex translatione criminum fit translatio nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> saith <hi>Tert.</hi> they would take the Gentiles sinne to them: God gave them their name too. Yea the most odious of the Gentiles, even <hi>their</hi> names hath the Prophet transferred unto the Iewes: ye Princes of <hi>Sodom,</hi> ye People of <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> saith <hi>Esay</hi> to the <hi>Israelites.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Iewes named not Gentiles, but with scorne, Sinners, Dogges, Slaves, Idolaters, shunned their company, would not so much as bid, good morrow; or good even to them, curse them in their Prayers. Will they in their lives follow such base Precedents? One will not be his enemies Ape. An <hi>Israelite</hi> to Heathenize? A <hi>Iew</hi> to live <hi>Gentiliter?</hi> Tis Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> phrase, God had warned them of their wayes; <hi>Nolite discere, Learne them not,</hi> saith the Prophet. <hi>Whoredome</hi> is one of them: God would not have an Harlot in <hi>Israel.</hi> They walke (Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith) <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in the perpetuall passion of their lusts; <hi>give</hi> themselves to wantonnesse, uncleanenesse, all uncleanenesse, their <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, their very Occupation, Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> terme too. These had the Iewes set for their examples. <hi>Israel</hi> saith desperately, <hi>Ezech. 20. Erimus, sicut Gentes,</hi> they would be like the <hi>Gentiles. Moab</hi> and <hi>Seir</hi> checke them with it, <hi>Ezech. 25. Iudah</hi> is like the Heathens. Say they might slander them; they were their enemies. The Prophet checkes them with it, checkes and charges <hi>Israel</hi> with all kinde of wickednesse, more than the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, Ezec.</hi> 5. yet his charge is but generall. <hi>Osea</hi> names particulars, Whoredome, Theft, Blasphemie, Murthers outragious, bloud touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing blood.</p>
            <p>But haply they will say, this was old <hi>Israel,</hi> long before their times: <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, what was that to them? Because the Fathers eate soure grapes, must the childrens teeth be edged? What hath Saint <hi>Peter</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them? What hath any man? Saint <hi>Steven</hi> hath, <hi>As your Fathers did, so doe you.</hi> That (they will say too) is but generall. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> hath in particular, the very next words to my Text, Drunkennesse, a damme-sinne; yea and one also of her daughters, Wantonnesse: <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, but one word, as Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> saith, <hi>In re alia,</hi> but bigge too, great with many young, a generation of Vipers in her belly, all uncleannesse; in speech, Ribaldrie, in Act, Fornication, Adulterie, Incest, Rape, and some moe not to be named. These were the <hi>Gentiles</hi> lusts; and the <hi>Iewes</hi> had lived in them. Nay, hee hath a greater yet; Idolatrie: that was Gentilisme indeed. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> calls it but Hellenisme; as if but Greekes onely were Idolaters. But it was the <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the lust of all the Heathens, cald therefore Paganisme. A Whoredome too, a spirituall Whoredome. And in this lust <hi>Iewes</hi> followed stript them. Every Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, but exceeded <hi>Gentiles;</hi> followed them, but so fast, that they out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had his God, one <hi>Baal,</hi> another <hi>Ashtaroth,</hi> a third <hi>Moloch,</hi> a fourth <hi>Nergal,</hi> others <hi>Adrammelech,</hi> and <hi>Rimmon,</hi> and <hi>Chemosh,</hi> and <hi>Thammuz, Israel</hi> had them all. But this (they will say) was old <hi>Israel</hi> too. Surely the extent of these <hi>Iewes</hi> Idolatrie, I can not readily tell. But Saint <hi>Peter</hi> gives it an odious Epithet, <hi>abominable</hi> Idolatry. The Paraphrast mends it not, calls it the <hi>worship of devills.</hi> Say then, if twere not time, they left these lusts, that were now turned to God.</p>

            <p>Shall I presse the Pronowne here againe, and so end? Would God I could not; that we though Christians, Christians borne, not (like these Iewes) converted onely, lived not <hi>Gentiliter,</hi> in all the lusts of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holiest of the Heathens.

Nor yet doe these Wine-wantons kneele in honour to the King: they will do as much to the meanest of their Mistresses. Nay that which Heathens would not offer, sobrietie suffers violence. As King <hi>Assuerus</hi> feast no man might force another. Wee doe; and that not as the <hi>Grecians,</hi>

But better (saith that Father) that my body die sober, than my soule die drunke. Leave this lust every Christian. You are Gods servants. No <hi>man</hi> will like a drunken servant.</p>
            <p>Come to the Daughter, Wantonnesse, a lust too common too. Of Sathans sixe daughters, Pride, Vsury, Hypocrisie, Ravin, Simonie, and Lust, he bestowed five of them on severall sorts of men, but Lust, the last, on All. As Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> said of <hi>Arianisme,</hi> I may say of Lust, that the whole world is turned wanton. Belike we hold, as Heathens did, Fornication, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, an indifferent thing. At least we seeme to say with <hi>Mitio</hi> in the Comedie, <hi>Non est flagitium, crede mihi,</hi> I wis, tis no such hainous crime. Nay doe not some boast of it, an <hi>Africke</hi> fashion too? Mocke others, lesse leude than themselves, thats a Romish tricke; call them <hi>Spadones,</hi> and such other scurrile termes; <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, adorers of their lusts, <hi>Nazianzen</hi> too. Nay more, belie themselves, rather than seeme chaste, as Saint <hi>Austine</hi> saith, he did, before he was converted, <hi>ne vilior haberer, quo essem castior,</hi> lest his leud acquaintance should despise him for his honestie. Leave this lust too every Christian. Thou art a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Christs body: make not thy selfe the member of an <hi>Harlot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude; as if our Land had not lusts enough at home, we seeke <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Philoes</hi> terme, saile over the Ocean, fetch in beyond-sea-sinnes, as we doe fashions.

            <head>A SERMON PREACHED VPON PART OF THE NINTH ARTICLE OF THE CREEDE. The six and twentieth Sermon.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <q>The holy Catholick Church.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Speech defective; wants a word. We neede not fetch it farre: the former Article will serve to perfit it, <hi>Credo, I beleeve.</hi> But the same sense will not serve both. I beleeve <hi>in</hi> the holy Ghost; but I beleeve not <hi>in</hi> the Church. Not in the Pope, who is above the Church, he saith. Not in Saint nor Angell; not in Christs mother, higher then they both; Papists say that too: but in God onely. This kind of beleefe God alone claimes; no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Its a beaten distinction, yet the Schooles, <hi>Credo Deo, Deum, &amp; in Deum,</hi> Faith Civill, Naturall, and Divine. The Scoole hath it from S. <hi>Austin, Credo Paulo,</hi> I beleeve <hi>Paul,</hi> saith hee, and <hi>Peter,</hi> but not <hi>in Paulum,</hi> I beleeve on neither. And Sathan (saith he) <hi>Credit Christum,</hi> beleeves Christ, that is, confesseth him: but not <hi>in Christum,</hi> beleeves not in him. He were happy, if he did; hee should be saved then. So there are three Faiths; pardon my phrase, theres but one Faith, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith. Thats true; one Faith onely in Christ. But the word Faith hath three senses, Credence, Confession, and Affiance. Beleefe, here meanes but acknowledgment. I beleeve the holy Church, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Catholic Church, <hi>i.</hi> I acknowledge it.</p>
            <p>The Rhemists adde more in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15. say, we say safely, that <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi>
               <pb n="488" facs="tcp:173124:263"/> meanes but only, to beleeve the Church to be. It signifies also, to trust the same in all things. They cite the <hi>Nicene Creede</hi> for it; they meane the Creede of <hi>Constantinople;</hi> the <hi>Nicene Creede</hi> hath not that Article. <hi>Stapelton</hi> saith so too, I beleeve the Catholicke Church, <hi>i.</hi> I beleeve, whatsoever the Church holdeth. The grossenesse of this glosse, see by the other Articles; <hi>Credo</hi> in them all to have but one sense onely, two in this. <hi>Credo</hi> hath two senses, one in the former, touching the three persons, there <hi>Credere</hi> is <hi>Confidere.</hi> Another in these latter; in which it is but <hi>Agnoscere.</hi> I say, it hath two senses; but not in one Article. Here <hi>Credo Ecclesiam,</hi> not <hi>Credo Ecclesiae, I beleeve the</hi> Holy Church, <hi>the holy Catholicke Church,</hi> that is, I acknowledge it. I humbly acknowledge it; I doubt not, we All doe. All have not all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies; <hi>Fides non est omnium,</hi> is Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Aphorisme. Hee meanes <hi>hominum,</hi> All <hi>men</hi> have not faith; I meane <hi>Articulorum</hi> too; even of beleevers, all admit not all the Articles. Some not onely not all; but none at all. The Atheist denies all; saith (as <hi>Davids</hi> foole does) <hi>Non est Deus,</hi> theres no God. One would thinke, the whole world had no such infidell; <hi>Egypt</hi> had, <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> he askt, <hi>who is God? Babylon</hi> had, East <hi>Babylon, Nebuchadonosor.</hi> West <hi>Babylon</hi> hath had some. He that matcht <hi>Moses</hi> with <hi>Mahomet,</hi> cald them both, and Christ too, <hi>tres Barritatores</hi> the three famous brables or troublers of the world, (twas Pope <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the ninth) had no God in his Creede.</p>
            <p>But in the second Article of Christs divinitie, Infidels are infinite. All <hi>Iewes,</hi> all <hi>Mahometanes.</hi> I passe by the <hi>Apostata,</hi> and some moe, who sometimes Christians, yet denyed Christ. By the Pope I cannot passe, <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth Christs vicar, yet beleeved not Christ, called the Gospel a Fable, sayd to Cardinall <hi>Bembus, Quantas nobis opes peperit illa Fabula de Christo!</hi> And for the holy Ghost, had all men acknowleged him; there had beene no neede of the Councell of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> the first Councell.</p>
            <p>Now for the other Articles, doe all acknowledge them? why then sayes Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to them of <hi>Corinth, How say some among you, that there is no resurrection? Rome</hi> can sample this too: what heresie is there, but the Pope hath a part in it? Three or foure of them have doubted of the soules immortality. For this in question, my theme now, doth eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Christian give his <hi>Credo</hi> to it? I hope so; for I reade of no oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent. Indeede this Article is not in every Creede, found but in few [The <hi>Nicene</hi> hath it not, the right <hi>Nicene;</hi> the reputed hath; and one more in <hi>Epiphanius.</hi> None else, that I have seene, none publick and antient.] Not the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> onely, but the <hi>Communion of Saints</hi> too, is omitted in most Creeds. The latter (I thinke) in all, save the Apostles. But neither of them both is the lesse to be beleeved; but the more rather, in my poore opinion, which I humbly submit to your more learned judgements. They synods of the Church were mostly summoned for the censuring of hereticks, who had opposed the Faith, oppugned some Article of the Apostles Creede. The religious Bishops by their after-Creeds did but confirme this. All Articles in them were in this first, expressely, or implyed. What Articles of this the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks at times presum'd to question, those Fathers determined, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>establisht
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:173124:263"/> them in theirs. As especially the points which concerne Christ, or the holy Ghost. Other points of faith, as the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and of resurrection, save in the Apostles dayes, were never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted. The councells therefore after them did not (for they nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not) put them in their Creeds: very few did. Much lesse they of the <hi>Church</hi> to be <hi>Catholick and holy, the Communion of Saints, the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of sinnes, and everlasting life,</hi> none ever denyed them. That the not finding them in any Creed, but in the Apostles, argues they require the more undoubted Faith, as being never contradicted. They are onely in the Creede of the Councell of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> but <hi>ex superabundanti.</hi> And therefore with your learned leaves, I doubt not to insert this one word into this Article, to reade it <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>I beleeve the holy Catholick Church.</hi> Both it and the three following make no sentence with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it. Without <hi>Credo</hi> understood, they have no understanding. I bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row but the verbe; not the praeposition too.</p>
            <p>And yet why not? the Pope will warrant me to borrow both; will dispense with me at least. Is not the Pope the Church? They say, he is, the holy Father Pope is the holy mother Church. Not the head alone of it. That though too much, yet is little; <hi>that</hi> he was long agoe, the Churches head. Is he not <hi>Peters</hi> successour, whom Christ cald <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas,</hi> thats a head; a Pope sayd so. Hebrew is Greeke at <hi>Rome.</hi> I meane Syriak. Nor was it <hi>lapsus linguae,</hi> as once <hi>Fiatur</hi> was. It is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined by <hi>Turrian</hi> the Iesuite, and the notes in the Canon law. A head so long agoe, must now be growne to a whole body. The Pope is the whole Church. When we say, the Church; we meane the Romane Bishop, saith <hi>Gregory de valentia. Gerson</hi> makes him more. Great is the Popes growth. The Church was once the body, he the head; and yet that but usurpt too. Now <hi>Dimidium plus toto,</hi> the Church is but a part, the Pope the whole, saith that good Chancellour of <hi>Paris.</hi> I hope the Sorbon thought not so. <hi>Hervaeus</hi> saith too, hee is the Church <hi>virtualiter.</hi> If the Pope be the Church; then put in Praeposition too, <hi>Credo in sanctam ecclesiam,</hi> I beleeve in the Church. For in the Pope I may beleeve, for he is Christ; not Christs Vicar onely, but Christs selfe. One in the <hi>Lateran</hi> councell cald <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth his Saviour. I may beleeve in God, I must. The Pope is God, <hi>Felinus</hi> saith, a French Lawyer. The Glosse in the extravagant calls him, Our Lord God the Pope. He was thought but a Parasite that stiled Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the fift, Vice-God. The Canonists flatter worse, that make him Gods selfe. I am too long in this, if a man may bee too long in inveighing against such absurdities. To deale ingenuously, the Creede of <hi>Constantinople</hi> hath the praeposition, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and <hi>Drusius</hi> a great critick, maintaines the phrase. So may wee in his sense. For he makes it meane no more, then <hi>Credere Ecclesiam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The object of this <hi>Credo</hi> is the Church. The other Creeds gives it three titles, it is one, it is Catholick, and it is Apostolick. This but two, Holy and Catholick. It is fit, we first speake of her selfe, then of her Attributes. <hi>Very excellent things are spoken of thee, O thou daughter of God,</hi> thou Apple of Gods eye, and signet of his hand; Christs spouse and sister, his dove, and his beloved; the beautie of the earth, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritrix
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:173124:264"/> of heaven. But mine office now is not to preach her praises, but to teach her children. Beloved brethren, Gods children by the Church, bred in her wombe, fed from her brests, know, what your mother is. He is a wise sonne (they say) that knowes his father. Learne you to know your mother, you that are learners. Many of you can teach me.</p>
            <p>The Church is the Vniversitie of all Gods chosen people, from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> to Christs second comming; of them all. First for them all. The Church meanes not the visible confessours of Christ onely, apparent to the world. Many beleeve on Christ in the lands of unbeleevers; many serve him secretly under persecuting Kings. Christ hath his Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies among thornes; God a <hi>Iob,</hi> a just man, in the land of <hi>Hus.</hi> The Saints in heaven unseene, are a part of the Church too, the Church triumphant. Not <hi>viatores</hi> onely, <hi>comprehensores</hi> too, belong unto Christs body, and are members of the Church. What if I shall say, Angells are too? <hi>Aquinas</hi> doth, and Saint <hi>Bernard:</hi> Papists say more; some in hell too; all that are in Purgatory. Theres good cause to call it Catholick, that spreads so farre. <hi>Militans,</hi> and <hi>Triumphans</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine not all the Church; theres a part, <hi>peccata expians,</hi> saith <hi>Gregory de valentia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Come we to the attributes: first, it is holy. Gods Elect, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calls <hi>holy, Col.</hi> 3. 12. Christ gave himselfe for the Church, dyed for it, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> sayes, to sanctifie it, to make it spotlesse, blamelesse, holy to himselfe. How can it but be holy, washed by Christs blood? The Churches holinesse stands in two things, <hi>Purity of Doctrine,</hi> and <hi>sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of life. Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> must be on her brest. What Saint <hi>Paul</hi> craves in <hi>Timothie,</hi> one of her sonnes must bee much more in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, sound Faith, and holy life. For the first, though ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse looke rather at our life, then at our faith; yet there is an holy faith, Saint <hi>Iudes</hi> epithet, a most holy faith.</p>
            <p>Not onely this impuritie defiles the faith; but all Hereticall pravitie is a barre to holinesse. Heresie is hell-bred, saith <hi>Ignatius,</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. It is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Sathans seede, saith the same father. The Church abhorres it. Hereticks (I say) are not of the Church. <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> saith, they are: but <hi>Canus</hi> saith, they are not, <hi>lib. 4. cap.</hi> 2. In it they are, as onely <hi>Dealbati</hi> (Saint <hi>Austins</hi> word) white: For the Church ought to be, as <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>olicrates</hi> sayd she was in the time of the Apostles, an undefiled and chast virgin. When shee teacheth heresie, shee turnes adulteresse.</p>
            <p>For the other, holy life. <hi>Tota Pulchraes, thou art all faire, my love,</hi> may receive two constructions, orthodoxall both. Either that the whole Church is holy, no part of her impure; or that shee is so wholie, in life as well as faith; in manners, as in doctrine. Heathens charged the first Christians, when they assembled to serve God, and to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate Christs supper with murther of Infants, eating their flesh, and drinking their blood; with carnall copulation in the darke, promiscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and incestuous. Who can let Sathan from lyes? But <hi>Tertullian</hi> quits them. So do Papists serve us, cast false aspersions on our Church. I would they were not true of theirs. Worse, farre worse things true
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:173124:264"/> of them, then they falsely lay on us. What we shall be, God knowes: out landish leaven may sowre some of us. But since our parting from the Pope, and the sound Preaching of the Gospell, much impurity is purgd out of our Land. Yea the Churches sound members have also their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities. Her selfe saith, shee is <hi>Blacke, Cant. 1. 4. Nigra,</hi> but <hi>formosa,</hi> shee addes that, she is holy notwithstanding them. We wrestle to our power against all the power of darkenesse. We crave Gods grace; and he gives it, to walke in all obedience to his holy will and word. <hi>Ego dormio, sed Cor meum vigilat,</hi> the Churches words too, her eyes may winke, but her heart waketh. Her holinesse is not absolute, not perfit in this life; as Donatists and Catharists require. But yet tis <hi>Inchoata,</hi> she labours and indevours so much as God enables her.</p>
            <p>The Church is holy, but whence? Her holinesse is not her owne; tis given her. <hi>Native</hi> shee hath none; tis <hi>Dative</hi> all. Shee may say to God, <hi>Bona mea, Dona tua;</hi> That shee is Holy, it is wholly from him. Hee hath made her so two wayes. Partly by his Sonne, cloathing her with his Righteousnesse; thats but Imputative. And partly by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, who enableth her to every good worke; and that holinesse is inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. Inherent holinesse every man hath, must have, that shall be saved. The word (inherent) may offend some of little knowledge. But the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious will admit it without scruple. But that holinesse too stands on Gods sweete acceptance. It is full of weakenesse; but it pleaseth him in Christ. I say, the Church is holy, not in Christ onely, by his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse reckoned unto her; but also in her selfe. Not of her selfe; but in her selfe, by the workes of Regeneration; the fruites of her Faith, wrought by the grace of the sanctifying Spirit. For where the Church is, Gods Spirit is, saith <hi>Iren.</hi> and where the Spirit is, all grace is, he saith too.</p>
            <p>There are some more respects, why the Church is titled holy. It is consecrate to God; <hi>Sanctitas Iehovae,</hi> all things God craves to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate to him, are called <hi>Sancta, holy things.</hi> It is <hi>Holy,</hi> for the mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call union with her head. Christ honours her with his style. Holy is that Body, the Head whereof is God. Not by <hi>Synecdoche;</hi> every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is holy, <hi>Dicat unusquisque,</hi> saith Saint <hi>August. Sanctus sum.</hi> It is <hi>Holy,</hi> for that faith, which knits together all the members of the Church which Saint <hi>Iude</hi> cals <hi>Sanctissimam,</hi> the most holy faith. I meete with more; but I omit them.</p>
            <p>The Churches second Attribute is <hi>Catholicke.</hi> A darke terme, needs an interpreter. It meanes, vniversall; tyed to no one Condition of men onely, no one Country, no one Age; but is <hi>Omnium Temporum, Lecorum, Hominum,</hi> of all Times, all Places, and all Sorts of men. Will you heare a fourth from the <hi>Tridentine</hi> Catechisme? The Church called vniversall; because all that will be saved, must hold and embrace it. <hi>Patianus</hi> had another, but strained; cald the Church Catholicke, for Obedience to all the Commandements of God. For Place, <hi>David</hi> bounds it <hi>at the ends of the Earth, Psalme</hi> 2. For Time, it is <hi>yesterday, to day, and for ever.</hi> For Persons, Greekes and Iewes, Bond and Free, Male and Female, <hi>All are one in Christ Iesus, Gal.</hi> 3. 28. So ample is the Word, that it containes (saith <hi>Lirinensis) Omnes semper Vbique,</hi> All,
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:173124:265"/> ever, every where. The Synagogue was not so; that contained but <hi>Israel,</hi> and lasted but till Christ. The Church takes in all, and never ends. I meane <hi>Generice,</hi> not <hi>Individualiter.</hi> Some have beene of it, of all sorts, in all lands, one time or other. All Lands have not at once had some Beleevers. <hi>Satis est, si successive,</hi> saith <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> it sufficeth, if at times.</p>
            <p>How then doth <hi>Solomon</hi> call it a Garden, <hi>a Garden enclosed?</hi> As I may not straine it, so I may not straighten it. A Garden; but not for the straightnesse of her ground, but for the sweetnesse of her graces. And the Inclosure is not for the confining of the Church; but for the safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Gods propriety in the Church. It is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

            <p>The Church is Christs Body, but his Body mysticall. It is not with it, as with a Body naturall. A naturall body hath the members all at once. But Christs mysticall members grow into his Body, some yester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, to day some, some to morrow. God chose them all together, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven before they were, before the Heavens were: but he cals them in their course, and incorporates them in Christ, one after another. <hi>Adam, Abel,</hi> and <hi>Soth</hi> first; <hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>Shem</hi> afterward. <hi>Abraham</hi> and his seed in their succeeding ages. The Gentiles in their time, our Ancestours, our Selves, our Children till Christs comming; the whole world of Beleevers in their severall generations. All the Faithfull of both Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Law and Gospell, make but one Chuch. Thats for time and for place; Christ is the Corner stone, that conjoynes Iewes and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles. <hi>Shem</hi> and his Sonnes onely, were sometimes; <hi>Iaphets</hi> seed were all Aliens. The Iewes, Gods Children; Gentiles but Dogges, Christs terme; strangers to the Covenant; without Hope, without Christ, without God, all Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> words, Christs Crosse (<hi>Pauls</hi> terme too) hath now endenized them, made them of Gods houshold.

So saith <hi>de Valentia,</hi> and other Romanists. How shall it doe, when there are two Popes at once, three Popes together? Nay, how shall it doe, when the Pope dyes.

            <p>To conclude, the members of the Church are sundred in person by farre distance haply both of time and place. Yet are they knit toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, all into one Communion, by one baptisme, and one faith, by the bond of the holy Spirit.

Heare the words, and hate the sinnne, all yee, that doe feare God. <hi>Thou shalt not</hi> (Gods selfe biddes) <hi>commit Adulterie</hi> And why not <hi>Thou? Samson</hi> did, a man reckoned among the Righteous. <hi>Heb. 11. Salomon</hi> did, whom God cald <hi>Iedidiah,</hi> his <hi>Beloved. David</hi> did, a man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods heart. What then? Vertue goes not by precedents. God therefore gave the Law; because all men are sinners, Saints and all, Saints on earth. To warrant sinne, cite not examples, <hi>Quid facta videam, cum verba audiam?</hi> What should I heede, what men doe, Let me heare, what God saith. Hee saith here, <hi>Non moe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaberis, Thou shalt not commit, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First why <hi>Thou;</hi> then why <hi>Not.</hi> For the former, Why that Person? Why that Number? For Person; why the Second? The Lawes of Men runne in the third mostly, both Civill, <hi>Nequis,</hi> and Canon, <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis.</hi> But the second seemes to speake more personally, more closely
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:173124:266"/> to every man. When I read, or heare, <hi>Non facies,</hi> Thou shalt not doe this; mee thinkes, God speakes to me, particularly; more, than if hee said, <hi>Ne quis facito,</hi> Let no man doe it. The third Person yeeldes more tergiversation, more evasion than the second.</p>
            <p>For the Number; it is not Plurall, but Singular. <hi>Non moechabimini,</hi> forbiddes not with that power, as <hi>Non moechaberis. Thou</hi> comes much nearer me, than yee; speaketh to me Individually. <hi>Eve</hi> was with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> when God forbade him the eating of one tree. Yet God said but <hi>Non comedes, Thou</hi> shalt not eate; held his Prohibition to be more powerfull so, then <hi>Non comedetis, yee</hi> shall not. <hi>Eve</hi> indeede tells the Serpent, God had said, yee shall not; and Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith so too, and presses it. But I will credit <hi>Moses</hi> more than <hi>Eve,</hi> or Saint <hi>Ambros.</hi> he read the 70. not the Originall. Nay Gods selfe saith, he said so, <hi>Gen. 3. 11. Hast thou eaten of the Tree, whereof I said, Thou shalt not eate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But yet againe for the Person, what <hi>Thou?</hi> As particular, as it seemes, it seemes not to meane Mee. For whom speakes God to? To All? <hi>Thou may</hi> meane so: but haply <hi>doth</hi> not <hi>here;</hi> seemes not. God saith but, <hi>Heare ô Israel, Deut.</hi> 5. 1. speakes but to Iewes onely, not Mee. I will aske with <hi>Pilat, Egone Iudaeus,</hi> am I a Iew? The other two I but toucht; I must tarry more on this.</p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Lex non est posita,</hi> The Law speakes not to all; not to the just. <hi>Legis ex moribus,</hi> Bad maners bred good Lawes. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

Adam</hi> had in his Innocencie. But we are fallen farre, even the holiest of us all, from the perfection of the Patriarkes. Besides Gods Law engraven in our soules, wee neede this too; the written Law: A double hedge, yet hardly holds us; two bands; we breake both. The best needes binding; no man hath Immunitie.

            <p>But the Gospell quits the Law, gives me Christian liberty. The band of the Law is not loosened by it. It is a faster tie to it.

It is <hi>Libertas,</hi> not <hi>Licentia.</hi> To live, as I list, were not Christian Libertie, but Heathenish Licentiousnesse. Christ hath freed me from the Law, that is, from the Curse of it, and from the slavish yoke of it.

            <p>Yet haply not All. The womans sexe may seeme exempt; and young men challenge Dispensation. For the former; the <hi>Thou</hi> is mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine in the Originall; as if God meant it onely to the male. The Iewes tongue seemes to sound so to a Iewes eare. But saving in things proper to one sexe, what is said to the one is meant to both. The one implies the other. God spake to <hi>Eve</hi> as well as <hi>Adam,</hi> when he said, <hi>Thou shalt not eate.</hi> Yet his termes were onely masculine. Yea, let wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men thinke the Law speakes more specially to them. For Murther, Theft, Drunkennesse, Adulterie, every sinne is more, farre more odious in a woman, than a man. Crave they expresse Scripture? <hi>Deut. 23. 17. There shall not be a whore among the daughters of Israel.</hi>

                  </gap>ubere;</hi> say, <hi>Thou shalt not,</hi> much oftener then <hi>thou shalt.</hi> Secondly, because so a Law is more breefe, and yet more ample. Negatives reach further then Affirmatives. <hi>Prohibitorium imperatur pluribus, Ambr.</hi> And thirdly Logick learnes us, they are stronger then they too. Precepts of both kindes Gods Law hath; Negatives as many, as the yeare hath dayes, as the Rabbins reckon them: far fewer Affirmatives. This <hi>Decalogue</hi> Negatives all save two: as it were, to binde us the faster to obedience. Thats generally for all? For this particular; the Negative note is more peremptory here; not so strong in some other, in the most. An Image I may make, so it bee not to fall downe to it. Sweare I may, before a Magistrate. Neglect the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> on necessity. Forsake my Parent, in some cases. Kill mine enemie in lawfull fight. Covet my neighbours house, his servant, or his beast; with his will, and on conditions. But commit adultery I may not, in any case on any condition.</p>
            <p>In those things, some circumstance may authorise, or excuse mee; none in this. <hi>Romes</hi> almighty Bishop cannot dispense here. Hee does <hi>de facto.</hi> Not indeede with adulterie: but with other sins coucht under it, some worse then it. He licenceth the Stewes, permits Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubines: that but single Fornication. Grants incestuous mariages; thats worse then adultery, somewhat worse. Yea <hi>Sodomie</hi> too; thats farre worse. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of <hi>Naples</hi> by his leave marryed his Aunt. <hi>Emmanuel</hi> of <hi>Fortugall,</hi> his wives Sister. One his owne sister, by Pope <hi>Martins</hi> Bull. <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fourth gave Cardinall <hi>Lucie</hi> leave, him and all his, to be <hi>Sodomites.</hi> But by his holinesse leave, this law beares no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence. The simplest fornication cannot be dispenc't with by the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-Crowned Pope. It is, but not <hi>de Iure.</hi> What God binds, man may not loose. Canonists say, Popes may. They are the Popes Parasites. Schoolemen wiser then they, say they cannot. <hi>Aquinas</hi> the best of them saith, the ten Commandements are <hi>Indispensabilia,</hi> admit no dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himselfe saith, the Popes Champion, the Pope cannot <hi>dispense in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Theres one case in which private men will be Popes, will give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves indulgence for single fornication. In some weakenesse of body, for recovery of health, and some leud Phisitian will give that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell too. But both patient and Physitian may so goe to hell together. Let no man slay his soule to ease his body. I have beene long in the person and the particle: I come to the maine terme; of two words, Act, to <hi>commit;</hi> Object, <hi>adulterie;</hi> both but one in the originall.</p>
            <p>Both Greeke and Hebrew, and other easterne tongues have but one word. Yet least some wanton may stumble at the phrase; one word of it. Thou shalt not <hi>commit.</hi> May I Iust and not be guilty? thinke it, so I act it not? Thats not the meaning. Theres an adulterous eye, Saint <hi>Peter</hi> saith; an adulterer <hi>Aspectu,</hi> as well as <hi>Actu,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose, Quoties concupiscimus, toties fornicamur,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Hierom.
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:173124:268"/> Sirachs</hi> sonne saith, <hi>concupiscentia spadonis devirginavit juvenculam,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Eunuches <hi>Lust</hi> deflowres a Virgin. The body is not fould but by the act; but the soule is by the thought. It is not my Glosse on it, but Christs; who but looking on a woman lusts withall, hath committed adultery, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 28. Every precept forbids sin in word, and thought, as well as act. So doth this, and in this terme. Not the doing the act onely, is to commit it. But the ribald in his tongue, and the luster in his heart, commits it too. As well the verball, and mentall adultery is meant here by commiting, as the reall and actuall, and <hi>the Law is spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall,</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith.</p>
            <p>But why adultery? why not some wider word of more extent, to forbid <hi>all</hi> uncleannesse? Adultery is but one. The Law is presum'd to permit, what it forbids not. Belike then Fornication is no sinne. The Gentiles thought so; as appeares by Saint <hi>Iames, Act.</hi> 15. 20. It is <hi>inter adiophora,</hi> forbidden by him there among other things indifferent. Or if it be a sinne; why is not put here rather then adultery? Had the Law forbidden that; it had implyed this too. If I may not <hi>Scortari;</hi> lesse may I <hi>moechari.</hi> But who shall teach Gods spirit to speake? Lawes should bee short. Gods are. These specially. His Morall Law, but <hi>Decalogus,</hi> his ten Commandements, but ten words. No moe the most of them in some Greeke Fathers; foure in <hi>Moses</hi> Text, five in <hi>Pauls, Rom.</hi> 13. 9. This in both, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. But one word, but a pregnant one, <hi>Multarum rerum gravida,</hi> conteines many under it. A great <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> as in the other precepts; one limme of wicked lust for all.</p>
            <p>Lust is <hi>Hydra</hi> of many heads; <hi>Iustin Martyr</hi> calls it <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>: adultery, if either of the parties be marryed; Fornication, if both sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle; Whoredome, when with many; <hi>Stuprum,</hi> if with a Virgin; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest, if with a kinswoman; Rape, if there bee force. There bee more, which I name not for their abominable filthinesse. They are here prohibited all. All kinds of incontinencie; yea intemperancie too: It is Pandor to incontinencie. Drunkennesse, Idlenesse, Luxurie, Ribaldrie, whatsoever vice is enemie to chastitie, this commandment meanes them all. Time will not let me tax them in particular. I will take them all in grosse. Haply hereafter of them severally.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brutum ego,</hi> saith <hi>Salomon; David</hi> saith so too: both sayd they were beasts. We are all. Not as they meant, in ignorance; but in sinne. Every sinne is a brute beast. Anger a Lyon, Drunkennesse a Swine, and so the rest. But yet but one sinne, but one beast. But filthy lust is every beast; lusts promiscuously. So doth the Lecher, <hi>Omnium mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lierum vir,</hi> as <hi>Curio</hi> cald <hi>Caesar,</hi> lusts after every woman. Let mee not be partiall; women do so too, wicked women, <hi>lassata viris, nondum sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiata,</hi> saith the Satyrist of <hi>Messalina;</hi> I will not english it, for chast wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens sakes.

Hee meant in the leud opinion of the Lecher.</p>
            <p>Indeed the Devill saith to a Lechers soule, <hi>non sunt magna carnis peccata,</hi> it is Saint <hi>Austins</hi> note; the sinnes of the flesh are not so great.

               <hi>Mitio</hi> was of his minde, <hi>Non est flagitium,</hi> tis no such hainous crime; but <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a small fault in the Epigramme. Papists say, <hi>wee</hi> say so; worse then so; tis <hi>no</hi> sinne; lust is lawfull. Lying persons say so: and <hi>Salmeron</hi> the Iesuite saith, <hi>Lutheranes</hi> say so too, venerie is no sinne. saith not the Papist so? the Popes selfe so? One of them but reckons it, <hi>inter minora crimina,</hi> among pettie faults. His Cardinalls say so too; <hi>Tolet</hi> doth, saith tis no sinne, when tis <hi>ob sanitatem.</hi> Yea their Law saith, Canon Law, there's <hi>Honesta fornicatio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Gods Law censures all lust, not prohibits onely. You heare the prohibition, <hi>thou shalt not.</hi> Not here onely; it is often. <hi>There shall not be a whore among the daughters,</hi> nor a whore keeper among the sonnes <hi>of Israel, Deut.</hi> 23. Not the Law onely; some except against it, Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel too. You heard Saint <hi>Iames</hi> in the <hi>Acts;</hi> he bids <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, absteine. So doth Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> absteine from fleshly lusts. This is one, a maine one, the principall, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 19. Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> Flie fornication. Both <hi>nequis, Heb.</hi> 12. Let there bee no whoremonger: <hi>&amp; siquis,</hi> if there bee any; shunne him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. Not whoredome onely, but all filthinesse, not onely not bee done, but not bee named, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. Christs selfe to the adulteresse, <hi>noli peccare amplius,</hi> bids her sinne no more.</p>
            <p>But the Law here hath no paine. Heare the censure; the Lay-censure; in some cases, but stripes, but death mostly. Ecclesiasticall, the <hi>Lev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>
               </hi> shall curse the incontinent person; and all the people shall say, <hi>Amen</hi> to it. Even the adulterer, punished in many lands with death: scapes easily in ours. The antient Canons enjoyned him a long penance: a white rod, and a sheete for an houre or two serves us; too light a paine for so leud a crime. But there is a heavier censure then all this, eternall death, damnation. The fire of lust shall feele the fire of hell.</p>
            <p>Lust hath many paines on earth, beside the lawes. Sometimes beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerie; a harlot will bring thee to a morsell of bread, saith <hi>Salomon.</hi> sometimes loathsome disease, loathsome and infectious. Alwayes shame, shame indeleble. It shall outlast thy life, light on thy sonne af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thee, the sonne of fornications. Every mouth shall call him base. Yea a curse beside the shame; the base-borne child lightly proving leud. All these paines are but temporall. But the Apostle saith, <hi>Gods kingdome</hi> shall be shut against the Lecher. <hi>Without shall be dogges,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Iohn, i.</hi> whoremongers. Where without? In the Lake, that burnes with fire and brimstone; which is the second death, the everlasting death. Heare and feare all lusters after strange women. Tremble yee all here, that you may not tremble there: where the torments shall force you to gnaw your tongues for paine, and blaspheme God himselfe through the unsufferable anguish.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Christian. Catechisme is a large Field. The King hath not imprisoned the afternoone Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, in confining him to it. It is spacious e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. A Field? A Garden rather, the <hi>Garden of Eden,</hi> fruitfull and delightfull. Yea for some Priviledges, to be preferred before it. Theres no <hi>Serpent</hi> in it; theres no <hi>forbidden fruit</hi> in it: you may <hi>eate of every Tree:</hi> God excepts none. As out of <hi>Eden</hi> into Paradise went a great River: so doth there out of Gods Booke, into the Catechisme. Which breakes it selfe into foure Heads, <hi>Pishon, Gihon, Hiddekel,</hi> and <hi>Perat;</hi> the <hi>Creed,</hi> the <hi>Commandements, the Lords Prayer,</hi> and the <hi>Sacraments.</hi> These farre excelling those. The first onely of them had <hi>

            <p>The fourth fits best this Season, and this Day. This Day called <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> Sunday: and the Sacrament was ordained for a remembrance of Christs <hi>Passion.</hi> This Season; the dayes approach, which call us all to the Lords Table. To his holy Table none may rashly rush, none come
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:173124:269"/> unto his Supper, without due Preparation. Be that mine Office now, with your Patience, God assisting me, to prepare you to that Supper. Tis the last Question in the Catechisme; <hi>What is required of them that come to the Lords Supper?</hi> Tis there answered thus, <hi>To examine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, whether they repent them truely of their former sinnes, Stedfastly purposing to lead a new life; have a lively Faith in Gods mercie thorough Christ, with a thankefull remembrance of his Death; and be in charitie with all men.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>First for the Act, It is <hi>to Examine.</hi> Thats the preparative against the Sacrament. Our bodies before purging use Preparatives: should not our soules?

               </gap>, <hi>without Dissimulation.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith it twice of both. So must Repentance be: All must bee <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Pauls</hi> words too, in <hi>Simplicity</hi> and <hi>Sincerity.</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine thine, whether it be such. Hath thine Eye wept for thy sinnes? hath thy heart groned for them? <hi>Peter</hi> wept bitterly. <hi>Davids</hi> teares wet his bed, washt it. Weepe haply thou canst not: Sigh and grone thou canst. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, true Repentance is <hi>vix sine lachrymis,</hi> hardly without Teares, but never without Grones.</p>
            <p>The next Particular, is <hi>Purpose of new life.</hi> Next; for Repentance is idle without it. The Catechist hath coupled them; because they are <hi>individui,</hi> unseparable companions, cling so close together, that the latter is indeed a limme of the former. Hee Repents not, that Amends not, meanes not at least to mend his life. Death may defeate the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of his purpose; or God may suffer Sathan to tempt him afresh presently and powerfully. But there must be in his heart a Resolution at least, an intent of Reformation. It is not else true repentance. It is one part of repentance, (it hath two) <hi>Praeterita plangere, &amp; plangenda non committere</hi> saith Saint <hi>Grego.</hi> not to grieve onely for sinnes past, but to Resolve also not to doe them any more. Repentance (I should have noted that before) is a sorrow for sin past. Am I sorry for an Act, which I meane to doe againe? repeat, what I repent? Thats Repentance of Repentance. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. No man should repent, that he repented.</p>
            <pb n="504" facs="tcp:173124:271"/>
            <p>There is ever in Repentance a Detestation of sinne. Surely, I doe not loath, but I rather love that sinne, which I leave not. To the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar of <hi>Bethesda,</hi> and againe to the adulteresse, Christ cryed, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, bad them, <hi>Sinne no more.</hi> Hee that doth, prooves himselfe both a Dogge, and a Swine; and so unfit (as you heard) for Holy things. Hee returnes, as the one doth, to his vomit, and as the other, to his wallowing in the mire. To end this, the true Repenter lookes (as the Poet speakes) <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, both behind him, to bewaile sinnes past, and before him, to beware of sinnes to come. Say not, with the Drunkards, <hi>Cras sicut hodie,</hi> I will doe to morrow, as I did to day; but with <hi>Eliphaz</hi> in <hi>Iob, If I have done wickedly, I will doe no more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third is <hi>Faith,</hi> without which, Repentance is unprofitable. Not so onely, but dangerous; a degree to desperation. <hi>Iudas</hi> repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and <hi>Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n,</hi> but despaired both. Repentance sorrowes for sinne; but staies it selfe by Faith, comforts it selfe with Confidence on God, beleeves his gracious promises in Christ, and applies them to it selfe. Want of Faith weakens God. Pardon the Word. God is Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; theres no weakenesse in him. But want of Faith doth <hi>Ponere Obi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem,</hi> is a bolt and barre against Gods Grace. Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> saith but, Christ <hi>did not,</hi> but Saint <hi>Marke</hi> saith, Christ <hi>could not</hi> doe many workes, for the peoples unbeleefe. The <hi>Non-posse</hi> is from Mans in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulity, not from Gods Imbecillity. The Father of the Demoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acke said to Christ, if thou canst <hi>Doe:</hi> but Christ answered him, if thou canst <hi>Beleeve.</hi> Tis Faith, that enables: but whom? not God to <hi>Give</hi> Grace, but Man to <hi>Receive</hi> Grace. <hi>Omnia credenti possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> Christs selfe said, <hi>All things are possible;</hi> but <hi>to him, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Sacrament signifies; not so onely, but gives too; represents not onely, but presents grace to man, great Grace from God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferres, exhibits it. That point hath beene learnedly taught you in this place. Yet gives it not; but offers it, reaches it out to All. But they receive it onely, that beleeve. Faith onely apprehends it; is <hi>Os, manus, Oculus,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Ambrose,</hi> the Eye, that sees Christ, the Mouth and Hand that take Christ; <hi>Credere est Edere,</hi> say the Fathers, to Beleeve on Christ, that is, to Feede on Christ. Christ is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in the Sacrament; but to them onely that Beleeve. They receive him, and all benefits purchased by his Death. They All, but they One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. God tenders Grace; but all men are not capable. They are one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that beleeve. Gods Love is the Fountaine; Grace doth flow from it. But Mans Faith is the Conduit; it must runne through it. It is <hi>Grace that brings Salvation,</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Titus</hi> 2. 11. saith it twice. <hi>Ephesians</hi> 2. You are saved by Grace. Thats on Gods part. But there is somewhat on Mans' too: Hee must beleeve. Faith must lay hold on Grace. Christ hath said foure times, <hi>Fides tua servavit to, thy Faith hath Saved thee.</hi> Christ meant but of the Body; but it is as true, more true of the Soule.</p>
            <p>Examine this Thou, that commest to Christs Table. It is needfull ever, but then most. Thy Faith must be examined. But what Faith?
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:173124:271"/> Not <hi>Fides Historiae;</hi> whether thou beleeve the Scriptures. Iewes doe that; yet denie Christ. <hi>Agrippa</hi> did, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> sayd. Iewes doe? Devills doe, Saint <hi>Iames</hi> saith; <hi>beleeve, but tremble:</hi> beleeve God to bee just, Christ to have suffered. Devills doe; Men doe not; many men, Christian men: many in the Country; some (I doubt) in this City; beleeve not Christ. Not of incredulity; but of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; know not, what or why hee suffered; what or who hee was God or Man, Man or Woman. Reade they cannot; heare they doe not; or if heare, yet not heede. And how can they beleeve ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving not heard?</p>
            <p>But the faith, thou must examine, is <hi>fides misericordiae,</hi> my Text saith, <hi>Faith in Gods mercy through Christ.</hi> Not bare <hi>fides,</hi> but <hi>fiducia,</hi> confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence on God. Examine (I say) not <hi>fidem assentientem,</hi> a beleeving faith, that assents to truth in generall; but <hi>fidem sentientem,</hi> a feeling faith, that applyes the grace in the Sacrament to ones selfe. What if I beleeve, that Christ dyed, dyed for sinners? Sathan doth so. That faith will not save me. But the discreete Catechist hath used a word, which differenceth saving faith from that, termes it a <hi>lively faith.</hi> When thou commest to Christs Supper <hi>examine</hi> thy <hi>selfe,</hi> whether thou have that. Whether thou beleeve, that Christ hath dyed for thee, hath given his body, shead his blood for thee.</p>
            <p>The fourth is <hi>thanksgiving;</hi> an office meete for every Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant. Wee terme our comming to Christs Table, a receiving. It is fit that a receiver returne thankes. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, benefits require thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse. This Sacrament <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is cald <hi>the Eucharist,</hi> of this of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of thanksgiving. And the Priest, reaching the wine, bids <hi>Drinke it in remembrance of Christs blood shed, and be thankefull.</hi> There is cause. It is the signe, the seale of the greatest benefit, God ever bestowed on man, his redemption and salvation. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, saith Saint <hi>Basil,</hi> the greatest, and the royallest, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest of all the workes of God. <hi>Nihil tam dignum Deo,</hi> saith <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian.</hi> Nothing so worthy of God, as mans salvation. And of the <hi>Liturgie</hi> in the Sacrament, the greatest part is thanksgiving. And the Priest concludes it with the Anthem of the Angels, <hi>Glory be to God on high; Wee praise thee, wee blesse thee, wee worship thee, wee glorifie thee, wee give thankes unto thee, O Lord God, Lambe of God, Sonne of the Father, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Surely if Angells sung Glory; wee must more. They fell not, nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not to bee redeemed; were confirmed onely. Wee fell all once in <hi>Adam,</hi> fall still daily. Christ redeemed us, shead his blood for us. Tis meete wee thankefully receive so great salvation. <hi>Tis meete, right, and our duty to bee thankfull at all times for all graces: but especially for the pretious death of our Redeemer; with Angels and Archangels, and all the Company of heaven, to laud and magnifie Gods most glorious name, evermore praysing him, and saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hoasts, heaven and earth are full of thy glory; glory bee to thee, O Lord most high.</hi> Man is prone enough to pray for things hee wants; but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets thankes, having received them. Of ten Leapers cleansed, but one returnes to Christ, to thanke him. Prayer is of nature, thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:173124:272"/> of grace. Want forceth open every mouth to crave; Religion opens few to render thankes. <hi>Children</hi> can singe <hi>Hosannah,</hi> Helpe Lord; the boyes cryed so to Christ. But <hi>Hallelujah, praise the Lord,</hi> is the song of the Elders in the <hi>Apoc.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To end this, the Sacrament is a commemoration of Christs Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a remembrance of Christs death. The Catechist here craves that remembrance to bee thankefull. Atheists remember it; <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> doth, when hee calls Christ, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the crucified, the staked God. The Devills remember it; but they thanke him not. Pardon them; twas to their paine. But twas for our good, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test good, that God, God of all goodnesse could doe for us. Tis meet, that wee not onely remember it, but be thankfull.</p>
            <p>The last thing is <hi>Charitie;</hi> next to <hi>glory unto God,</hi> followes <hi>peace towards men.</hi> Christ bids, when I offer my gift upon the Altar, goe first unto my brother, and bee reconciled to him. Christ craves more then the Catechist; and it is a point worthy our observing. The Cathechist requires but our love towards our brethren. Thats chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty active. But Christ craves more, our brothers love to us. Thats charity passive. My brother is offended, I have wronged him. I love <hi>him;</hi> I have reason, should I doe him wrong, and hate him too? Hating him not, I make no scruple of going to the Sacrament, to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer there to God, my prayers, and thanksgiving. May I doe it? I may not. Christ gives mee an <hi>Apage;</hi> tis in the Text, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, both are one, bids, <hi>get me gone, and be first reconciled.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tis <hi>Durus sermo,</hi> a hard saying; <hi>durus,</hi> but <hi>verus,</hi> hard, but to bee heard, heard and obeyed. Right first the wrong, thou hast done him, and come then: but not till then. Will hee not be satisfied? or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignes hee thee without a cause? <hi>Liberasti animam tuam,</hi> thou hast done thy duty; thou mayst come, if thou maligne not him. Bee <hi>thou</hi> reconciled to him, (Christ bids thee) if thou canst. If not: hate thou not him, not any; the Catechist here bids that. Tis in thy power to pardon them, that trespasse thee: doe that. Thou cravest pardon of Christ, cravest it on that condition; prayest God to forgive thee, as thou dost forgive others. If thou doest not, thou meanest revenge. Then bearest thou malice, and art not in charity. Thou art no guest for Christ: thou lovest not him, hating thy brother. That Disciple, whom Christ loved, saith, hee loves not God, that loves not man. Censures him further, calls him a lyar, a man slayer, shuts him out both of light and life, eternall life. This made the Christians in the primitive Church to kisse each other at the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; cald <hi>Osculum pacis,</hi> the kisse of peace, in signe of love.</p>
            <p>To end this, nothing resembles God better then love; <hi>God is love:</hi> nothing the Devill more then malice. Sathan signifies spight. Come not with it to Christs table. <hi>Quid mihi &amp; tibi? Waht have I to doe with thee?</hi> sayd the Devill to our Saviour. What hath the man of malice to doe with Christ the God of love? And therefore I beseech you in the feare of God lay all these particulars to heart, and doe what our Church here injoynes you: examine your selves, not others; and in
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:173124:272"/> speciall examine your repentance whether it bee true: your purpose whether it bee stedfast: your faith whether it bee lively, your thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse whether it be reall, and your charity whether it bee with all men: And the God of love the giver of all grace, give to all that come unto Christs Supper, this sorrow for sinnes past, purpose of new life, faith, thankefulnesse, and love, blesse that holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament to the comfort of their soules, for his sake that ordained it; <hi>Cui cum patre, &amp;c.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>It is a right in marriage, a Ceremony in <hi>Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie,</hi> some one to give the woman to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried. God performes that; he delivers her to <hi>Adam;</hi> and the Priests office too, in joyning the Man and Woman together, he also performes that, <hi>Matth. 19.

Thy child is but a dorp of thy seed: but thy Wife thy one halfe. Thy Parents bodies are in thee; but thy Wives soule is in thee. I have heard some say, that a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man hath no soule. Tis no such strange Paradoxe, if they meane a wife. Is it not in her husband? Her soule (saith <hi>Seneca) Spiritus illius in meo vertitur,</hi> the soule of the wife, lives and moves, and is in the soule of the Husband.</p>
            <p>These are the premisses to this Conclusion. For that cause, and for this, a man shall leave his Parents, and cleave unto his wife.

            <p>
               <hi>For this shall a man leave father and mother:</hi> shall <hi>leave</hi> them, tis not, shall <hi>forsake</hi> them. The word in the Originall indifferently sounds both. But the Churches discretion waighing both words, made choise of this. To forsake the Parents counsell, were undutifull, but their <hi>les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> onely. But their <hi>persons,</hi> great ungraciousnesse. Such a sonne doth <hi>Solomon</hi> adjudge his name to shame, and his eyes unto the Ravens. To forsake a Parent, a child to forsake him, that begat him, her that bore him: who, that which <hi>Paul</hi> saith, wee have of God, I may almost say, he hath from them, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

There is <hi>no</hi> cause, no <hi>worldly</hi> cause; Ghostly one is. Question comes haply be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene God, and thy Parents, that thou must forsake the one: thy Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:173124:274"/> then must pardon the. Yea thy wife, for whom God here gives thee leave to leave thy Parents, must excuse thee too. <hi>Forsake</hi> them <hi>both,</hi> thou maist, thou must, <hi>For Christs sake, and the Gospells.</hi> Christ approves that <hi>Propter;</hi> not approves it onely, but rewards it too, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it richly, <hi>in hundred fold in earth,</hi> infinitely in heaven.

            <p>There are, that adde a second, or that at least racke this, beyond the reach: that will have here comprehended, the Masse under the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and Christs Vicar under Christ.

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>c, &amp; propter hanc,</hi> for the Popes sake, and the Masse, forsake not Parents onely, the fathers of their flesh; but their Soveraignes too, the fathers of their countrey. Not forsake them onely in affection; but plot both the disturbance of their states, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of their Parsons. <hi>Persons</hi> avouches it. But Christ is not the Pope, nor is the Masse the Gospell. Forsake our Parents, but <hi>propter Deum</hi> onely, we may not, but for God alone, for Christ. Popes are but Vice-Gods, but Vice-Christs. Christs warrant is but <hi>propter me;</hi> for himselfe, not for his Vicar. To forsake Parents for his sake, is grosse impietie, if but naturall Parents: but if our Parents Father, <hi>Caesars</hi> selfe, tis <hi>sacrum scelus,</hi> execrable leudnesse. Tis here then but a leaving onely, <hi>For this a man shall leave.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is but a removing onely of the Person, not the Affection; a depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from the Parents, not in filiall dutie, but in body; a ceasing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide with them. The Sonne but leaves his Fathers house; and foundes him a new family. So doth the daughter. For my Text is for the woman, as well as for the man. Shee shall leave her Parents, to cleave unto her Husband. Not leave to love, to honour them; that both the man and the woman must doe still; both leave to live together. But he and she must leave them; that is, as the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphrast glosses it, their chamber, house, and family, and beginne one of their owne.</p>
            <p>Nor is this so light a matter, as seemes haply. Not so unkinde, so unnaturall, so vast, as the forsaking was, the disclaiming, the denying, the renouncing of ones Parents, nay the wishing and working their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction. But even this too, this onely leaving them, but a locall lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them, (tis little more) is with some loathnesse, yea even with ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie to a vertuous child, especially a daughter to leave the Parents quite, that bred, that fed, that fostered her: the Father her honour, and the Mother her grace; they both, her crowne and countenance; his face her comfort, and her eyes her joy: and the greater the Parents, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter griefe so too, and the farther the remove, the passion greater still.</p>
            <p>The Passion in the Parents as well as in the childe: the Daughter loath to leave them, they as loath shee should, but that shee must. Shee is now, as <hi>Epictetus</hi> saith of a daughter, <hi>aliena possessio,</hi> no longer theirs, but another mans possession; her husbands, not her Parents they have past away their right, and therefore may not hold her. Their loves will
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:173124:274"/> make all lets they may. <hi>Rebeccaes</hi> mother prayes that her daughter may stay but tenne dayes with her. The <hi>Levits</hi> wives father <hi>Iud.</hi> 19. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treates his Sonne in law, hasting to goe home, to stay three dayes with him. When the fourth was come, and they ready to depart, he praies him stay that night. When the fifth was come; he delaies delaies him then till noone, and faine would draw him on, to tarry one night more. But after all their loathnesse, after all their loves, and for all the right, that they had in her before; <hi>Propter hoc, for this cause,</hi> God hath given her to a husband, and she now is of his flesh, she must, she will, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, loath, but yet willingly, leave Father and Mother, and cleave unto her husband. <hi>Father and Mother?</hi> thats not all; though God say here no more. <hi>Zorobabel</hi> in <hi>Esdras,</hi> addes to them, Country too; a man will leave his Country for his Wife. That which <hi>Plato</hi> saith is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, dearer to him then his Parents, a mans Country: It will hee leave for her. So will shee for him: not <hi>Rachel</hi> onely and <hi>Rebecca,</hi> women of meaner birth; but even a Kings Daughter, great King <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>leave her owne people, Psal.</hi> 45. 10. travell from <hi>Egypt</hi> to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> from <hi>Nilus</hi> to <hi>Iordan,</hi> as it were from <hi>Thames</hi> unto the <hi>Rhine,</hi> to marry <hi>Solomon,</hi> forsake her native Country, not forsake onely, but <hi>forget her owne people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is no wrong done to the Parents. Are not themselves acces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries in this Act? Have not the Spousals their assent, the Nuptials their joy, the truest joy and freest of all their life? Is not the whole bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse of their childrens thus leaving them transacted by themselves? The daughter is indeed <hi>aliena possessio;</hi> but the Alienation is the Parents Act. Are House and Goods the Parents gift, a Wife the Lords? So <hi>Solomon</hi> said. Surely the Wife is the Parents gift too; not indeed my Parents, who doe marry her; mine give me to her; but her Parents, that is married; they give her to me. The Wife to the Husband, and the Husband to the Wife, both are the Parents gift. Both are, or should be, where Parents are. Love delaies the delivery, but it hinders not the grant. Sonne or Daughter, the Parents give them willingly, cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</p>
            <p>Surely the Childe is deare unto the Parent; the breath of it (as saith the Tragicke) the breath of my Childe, nothing so sweete, as it. My life not dearer then my Childe: as <hi>Iudah</hi> said of <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Benjamin,</hi> the soule of the Father hangeth on the soule of the Childe. Yea <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a Greeke Historian saith, Children dearer to the Parents then their lives. That <hi>David</hi> showed, <hi>O Absalon, my Sonne Absalon, would God I had dyed for thee, O Absalon my Sonne, my Sonne.</hi> And will love let the Parent give away the Child? Will a man part from the fruite of his body? Will a woman give away the Childe of her wombe? The ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest begger will not doe it; shee will rather beare it at her backe. Yet in this case they will, all will, from the beggar to the King, <hi>Propter hoc, for this cause.</hi> The Father even in person, in the open Congregation, will give away his daughter. The Mothers heart haply earnes at the present Act; but the passion over, shee likes well of it. Yea though as Christ saith of his Spouse, she be the Mothers <hi>vnica,</hi> her onely daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and therefore very deare to her; yet she is content. The Child was
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:173124:275"/> their Possession, God had given her them <hi>Eve</hi> saith both, of the first childe in the world, <hi>Possedi a Domino;</hi> the childe their right, the justest right from God. That right the Father surrenders there againe to Gods Commissioner: all <hi>propter hoc,</hi> for God, to give her to the man, and to make them both one flesh.</p>
            <p>To end this second point, A man shall leave both Father, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for his Wife, not to be a Husband, is to cease to be a Sonne, or a Wife to be a Daughter. But that the bond of Wedlocke is the closest of all bonds. It excels them, but dissolves them not. I say, this leaving of the Parents looseth not the duty, which the Law laies on the childe. <hi>Rachel</hi> though marryed to <hi>Iacob,</hi> yet prayeth pardon for her duty of <hi>Laban</hi> her Father. Shee did it not: but in praying pardon she acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged it. <hi>Ioseph</hi> did it; though in power and honour next the King, yet did reverence to his father, great reverence, <hi>pronus in terram,</hi> even with his face downe to the ground. Not in case alone of Reverence, but also of reliefe, obedience, Protection, and whatsoever duty is compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed besides, within that generall terme of Honour. But still with this <hi>Proviso,</hi> that the duties to be done of the childe unto the Parent, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbe not the conjunction betweene the marryed couple. They must give place to this, as both the straighter bond, and the more ancient. The Decalogue is yonger then this Institution. Husband and Wife were before Childe and Parent. <hi>Sinai</hi> must yeeld to <hi>Paradise.</hi> That which God bids, doth dispense with that, which <hi>Moses</hi> bids. Or say, that God bids both; <hi>Moses</hi> was but Gods mouth. God commands not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. The one includes the tacite exception of the other. That abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates not this. Say the most you can against it, that God speakes not <hi>Praeceptive,</hi> but <hi>Permissive</hi> onely: yet so it is an Indulgence. The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is the Law; and a man is tyed to that. But Wedlocke hath a Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; and the marryed man by it, say, it be not, (shall leave,) yet tis (<hi>may leave</hi>) at the least, <hi>both Father and Mother, and cleave unto his Wife;</hi> the last point in my Text.</p>
            <p>Which whether it describe the Marriage Bond, or define the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage Duties, I will not define. Say it be the first. Christ hath but called it a conjunction; it is more. Conjunction is sometimes of things remote, The Sunne and Moone are farre asunder, even in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction. Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> terme hath more <hi>Emphasis,</hi> and the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists have it too, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, tis an Agglutination. Glew joynes two bodyes as but one. My <hi>Texts</hi> terme is significant: can things be closer, then cleave together? But Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> terme is more preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. Glew not closeth onely, but fastens too, fastens so firmely, that the bodyes joyned together will rather rend in the whole, then sever in the joynt. The Bond of Marriage is Indissoluble. Of two things glewed together, the one will pull away with it, a peece from the other, rather then twill part from it. See wee it not in this very Subject? Death offers violence to this Bond, and <hi>will</hi> dissolue it. The Man and Wife must yeeld. They must, but will not. Death sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders them by force; but how? The one pulles away with it a part from the other: and the part is the heart. The corpse of the dead car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries away with it even the soule of the Surviver. Not the Soule onely,
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:173124:275"/> but the body too sometimes. Doth not one moneth, one week, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times one day, bury both Wife and Husband? Not in contagious times, (then tis no marvaile) but meerely through the tenacitie of this Glew, the bond of Wedlocke; it hath so sodered their soules together, that the man will say of the woman, as <hi>Iacob</hi> did of <hi>Ioseph,</hi> surely I will goe downe into the grave unto my Wife sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>So straight, so firme is the bond of marriage, that not onely not Christs terme expresses it, a conjunction, to bee joyned together; but not my Texts terme neither, an <hi>Adhaesion,</hi> to cleave together; no nor yet that of Saint <hi>Pauls,</hi> an agglutination, to bee glewed together. Glew but makes two things as one, <hi>quasi unum:</hi> but marriage makes two, meerely one; the words next to my Text, <hi>and they twaine shall bee one flesh;</hi> meant not in the children of their bodyes, that the parents shall be one in them, as the Greek Fathers mostly conster it, moved by the phrase, <hi>in carncmu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>um.</hi> Christ hath removed that scruple, <hi>una caro sunt, they are one flesh.</hi> The Wife and Husband, though they never have child, or if they have, yet before they have, yea before one know the other, for the very instant of the marriage, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> saith our Saviour, they are no longer two, but even then are one flesh. And therefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calls the womans flesh, her husbands, and a mans wife, himselfe. And this not Religion onely teacheth, but Law too; which reputeth the wife, and the husband but one person. As when God formed <hi>Eve</hi> of <hi>Adam,</hi> he made one two: so when hee brought her to <hi>Adam,</hi> he made two one.</p>
            <p>But say this member rather meane the marriage duties; that this is the project of that <hi>propter hoc;</hi> the man shall leave his parents, but to cleave unto his wife. A new bond, but a straighter; <hi>vinculum mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talc,</hi> straighter then <hi>parentale;</hi> a straighter, but a sweeter; but because he is bound, as it were, but to himselfe; and for that it binds the wife as well him, to performe as much as hee, in her place, and to her skill. And what is that? Three duties, each word one, <hi>tria sunt omnia,</hi> love loyaltie, and societie. For there are here a <hi>verbe,</hi> a <hi>pronoune,</hi> and a <hi>nowne.</hi> The <hi>nowne</hi> claimes love, it is a wife, the mans owne flesh, owne selfe, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. The <hi>pronoune</hi> loyaltie, shee must bee <hi>his,</hi> else the Glew lets goe; in that onely case, the Soder yeelds. The <hi>verbe</hi> societie, the mutuall enjoying each of others presence, he must cleave to her. Nay indeede the <hi>verbe</hi> alone implyes them all. Love; cleave I to her, whom my heart hateth? Loialtie; hee that haunts strange wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, leaves hee not his wife? Societie; whom I debarre my bed, my board, my house too haply, shall I say, I cleave to her? But to lay <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, one word but to one point. Bee the first but onely for societie.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Psalmist</hi> holds it seemely, <hi>brethren should dwell together.</hi> Tis then unseemely, tis absurd, man and wife should live asunder. Absurd for the man; shee is his crowne of glory; more absurd for her; hee is her light. Hee as the Sunne, shee as the moone; shee cannot turne her body from him, but with her owne disgrace. For whose mutuall enjoying each of others companie, <hi>Moses</hi> Law exempted the new
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:173124:276"/> marryed man from warfare, and all services, that should sever man and wife. That scuse in the Gospell he might plead by Law, <hi>uxorem duxi,</hi> hee had marryed a wife. Thy wife is thy dove; Christ so calls his Spouse. The Dove having chosen once his fellow keepes with her till shee dye. Thy wife is thy companion; so the Prophet calls her. Shouldest thou then not live with her, dwell together, eate together, sleepe together, shee in thy bosome, that is <hi>Moses</hi> phrase, thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene her brests, as Christ did with his Spouse. Leave not her, that left, Parents, Friends, Country, all, to follow thee. Christ <hi>Pauls</hi> type of marriage, is ever with his Spouse the Church; in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy with the Church Triumphant, in spirit with the militant. The Pope would bee his vicar in his absence. But husbands use not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties.</p>
            <p>The second thing was loyaltie. There is a cleaving to an harlot, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. There is a woman, but a stranger. Yea there is a wife, but ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans, a neighbours wife. <hi>Salomon</hi> and <hi>Moses</hi> forbid a man their company. His company is confined. Tis a wife, whom he must cleave unto: but it must be his owne. If to anothers, tis adultery. Fornication a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oule sinne, single fornication. Adultery farre worse. This is double adultery; he a womans husband, shee a mans wife; an <hi>hyperbole</hi> of absurditie, <hi>Chrysostome</hi> calls it. What sinne greater? what so great? not theft, the wise man saith it, <hi>Salomon.</hi> Not perjurie, a wise man too saith so, twas <hi>Solon.</hi> Not Idolatrie; <hi>Chrysostome</hi> durst say that. Theft not greater then adulterie; for in adulterie is theft, theft of a high na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Plagium,</hi> double <hi>Plagium;</hi> he robbes too; the womans husband, and his owne wife. Say not, he cannot robbe his wife; for shee is him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. One may bee <hi>Felon dese.</hi> Perjurie not greater. The Leacher will forsweare: the court presumes it, that puts him to compurgators. Nay, Idolatrie not greater. I know not <hi>Chrysostomes</hi> reason, why hee sayd so. But I finde in Scripture above five and twentie thousand slaine in one day in revenge of this sinne; almost ten times as many as fell for Idolatrie, that famous Idolatrie of the molton calfe. Endures a man his wife to trespasse him? Forsakes he not her instantly? For her hee left his parents; but for it he will leave her. But he teaches her disloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altie by his example. If thou thirst, drinke; but of thine owne cesterne. As thou wouldst thy waters should be thine onely; so onely drinke of thine. But what (will you say haply) if hee have a second wife? as <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mech</hi> had; nay sa an holier man, then he had, as <hi>Iacob</hi> had, as <hi>David</hi> had, shall he not cleave to her? Shee is a wife too; and his wife too. Wee live not by examples, but by lawes. Saints have their sinnes, earth-Saints. Gods Law forbids all <hi>Polygamie.</hi> And yet theres one maintaines it, no meane man neither, a Kings fellow, a Cardinall: it is <hi>Cajetane.</hi> God made but one <hi>Eve</hi> for one <hi>Adam:</hi> and Christ faith not, they three, but <hi>they two shall be one flesh.</hi> And my Text hath here of purpose used the number singular, <hi>he shall cleave unto his wife,</hi> not to his wives. Thats the last word of my Text.</p>
            <p>The duty that word tendereth, I sayd was love. Love is a little word, and speld but with few letters. But within the few letters of this little word, are couched all the duties, that man doth owe to man; yea that
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:173124:276"/> man doth owe to God: much more, that this man here, the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band owes the wife. Let him but love her; and hee will both live with her, and bee loyall. This is the <hi>unum necessarium,</hi> the maine point in marriage. Let the wife have house, apparell, jewells, all things, that the man can give her: If bee love her not, if shee bee chast, the All is nothing. This as it is sweete to her to have; so it is meete for him to give. Nature, Reason, and Religion binde him to it.</p>
            <p>Nature, shee is his flesh. <hi>Did ever man</hi> (saith <hi>Paul) hate his owne flesh, but nourish and cherish it?</hi> Reason; <hi>Shee</hi> loves <hi>him: and magnes amoris amor,</hi> love drawes love to it, like a Loadestone: He is unworthy it, that will not render it. Her care, her paines, paines active with his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, with his state; passive more, to bring him children, many me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits moe, deserve his love. Religion; God hath given him her; here comes in (<hi>Propter hoc</hi>) againe, <hi>for this cause, hee must cleave to her,</hi> cleave in heart to her, that is, must love her. And hee that gave her, bids to love her too, bids it often, <hi>diligite exores, love your wives.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude, that a man should love his wife, <hi>Paul</hi> held it reason strong enough, to say, shee was his flesh. And it is the <hi>Propter hoc,</hi> a part of it at least my Text intendeth. Her materialls are from man. But from what part of him? is't not from his side? That makes <hi>Pauls</hi> reason, and our <hi>(Propter hoc)</hi> yet stronger. From his side, where lies the heart, the seate of love; <hi>sumpta est de viro,</hi> shee was made of man. Not of his foote, lest he might have scorned her. Not of his head: so shee might have scorned him. But of his side; that the two next neighbours, the heart and armes might, the one affect, the other embrace her: as Christ in the <hi>Canticles</hi> doth his <hi>Spouse, the Church; his left hand under her head, and his right arme clasping her.</hi> That the mans soule, there sited too, might, as <hi>Sichems</hi> did to <hi>Dinah,</hi> cleave unto his wife; the soule might love her neighbour, as her selfe.</p>
            <p>My brother is deare to me; my friend is more; not nearer onely, as <hi>Salomon</hi> sayd, but dearer also then a brother. A mans wife is both to him, as Christ calls his Spouse, <hi>amica mea, soror mea,</hi> both his sister and his friend; and therefore worthily cald also there, cald often his <hi>beloved, pulchra mea, dilecta mea,</hi> his faire one, and his love; his eyes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delight, the Prophet calls her. In her he must joy, joy <hi>jugiter,</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually. So <hi>Salomon</hi> bids; especially, if shee be <hi>uxor adolescentiae, the wife of his youth.</hi> Shall I say yet more, but one thing more, and end with it? The Apostle bids him love her, <hi>even as Christ loved the Church.</hi> He gave himselfe for it. So must the man for her, if she shall neede. <hi>David</hi> would for his <hi>Soone.</hi> Hee must not love her lesse, then his owne life: not be loath to lose even <hi>it,</hi> even to set light his life, to reskew hers. For is hee not her Saviour, as Christ is the Churches? <hi>Paul</hi> saith he is, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 23. and the <hi>Geneva</hi> Translation is too supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and the <hi>Rhemists</hi> too, to put in <hi>his</hi> for <hi>hers,</hi> that it might bee meant of Christ, not of the husband. Two honorable titles, proper un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:173124:277"/> Christ, in regard of his Church, her head and her Saviour, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost hath communicated them unto the husband. Not onely his wives head, and so the woman headlesse without man: but even her Saviour also, the Saviour of her body. And must therefore like our Saviour, give <hi>his</hi> body to save <hi>hers.</hi> Christ the Saviour of his Church, save both the bodyes of this Princely couple, raise joyfull issue of them both, blesse them with honour and all happinesse; and let all that love the Gospell and the King, say heartily, <hi>Amen.</hi>

               </gap>, not <hi>Laudable,</hi> but <hi>Honourable;</hi> not barely commendable, but meere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly honourable. The atchievement of this style is grounded upon sundry due and just regards.</p>
            <p>The first of the Founder. Devises are credited by their Inventers, and Actions countenanced by their Agents. The worth of workes is waighed by their Authors; their reputation is their valuation; <hi>Exod.</hi> 31. The Arke and the Tabernacle, are both commended by the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the crafts-men, <hi>Psal. 78. Manna</hi> is commended by the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie of Angells, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 6. The Gospell is preferred before the Law, as for sundrie other reasons, so for this one; that <hi>Moses</hi> was the messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the one, but Christ of the other. Now marriage hath no meaner inventer, than Gods selfe. Wedlocke is Gods worke; and he to whom all honour belongeth, himselfe did institute this honourable ordinance. Yea the Lord yet further graced it; and whereas others of his ordinances were presented to us by the mediation and ministerie of Angells or men; hee hath honoured marriage with his owne Person. And as it is the custome of the Church, that some one must give the woman to be married, so <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 22. The Lord giveth her; and the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Minister, of joyning the man and the woman together, the Lord also performeth that, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 6. It is Gods coupling, <hi>House and goods,</hi> saith <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 18. are the Parents gift, but the <hi>wife</hi> is the Lords gift.</p>
            <p>The second regard is of the Solemnizer, <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. Christ himselfe in <hi>Cana</hi> of <hi>Galilee</hi> honoured marriage with his owne presence. It is a custome among men, to credite their feasts and solemne meetings with the presence of high personages, 2 <hi>Sam. 13. Absolom</hi> invited the King unto his house. The Prophets of God in former ages were of such ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, that Noble men, yea Princes, thought themselves honoured by their presence. <hi>Naaman</hi> a great man, and honoured in the <hi>Syrian</hi> court, waited with his horses and charets at the doore of <hi>Elisha;</hi> and yet could not speake with him neither, in person, but was answered by a messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. <hi>Saul</hi> intreated <hi>Samuel</hi> to honour him with his company, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. If these Prophets were a countenance and honour unto persons of so high estate; what then is Christ, whose shooe latchets <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi> who was <hi>more</hi> than a Prophet, was not worthy to untie? Nay more than that, it pleased Christ to doe the greater honour unto marriage, to shew forth there the first fruits of his Godhead; he graced the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grome with the handsell of his miracles.</p>
            <p>The third regard, is the approbation of the Spirit, I meane the holy Ghost, who in this Text and divers others, (as all Scripture is inspired by him) hath honoured marriage with sundry commendations: and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> telleth us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. that that is indeede honourable, which God doth honour. And thus we see in these three first regards, even all the Persons of the Godhead, the whole Trinitie to concurre and joyne together in honouring of this happie and holy state of Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie.</p>
            <p>A fourth regard may be of Place; a circumstance much tending of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes to the encrease of the credit of Things and Persons. It was
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:173124:278"/> disgrace to Christ to be brought up in <hi>Nazareth.</hi> They used to speake inscornefull Proverbe, <hi>can any good thing come out of Nazareth.</hi> The Lords promise unto <hi>Israel,</hi> to give them the lands of their enemies in possession is graced by the place; it was <hi>Canaan,</hi> a land that flowed with milke and hony. The place where marriage was first instituted, was the most honourable place of the whole world, even Paradise, Gods <hi>Eden,</hi> Gods delight; whose beauty one of the ancient Fathers saith was <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, unexpressible, unconceiveable; the garden of the earth; of such especiall excellency, that it was, as it were, the Heaven of the world. Nay Christ calleth the Heaven of heavens, the receipt of the Saints, and of the holy Angels, yea the place of Gods owne Mansion, by the name of it; <hi>hodie mecum eris in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diso.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next regard shall be of the use, the maine commender of all things to man, and the principall proportioner both of their praise and price. The uses of Marriage are both very excellent, and very mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold; but I will for shortnesse sake reduce them to three heads; the comfort of man; the procreation and education, <hi>id est,</hi> the bringing forth and bringing up of Children; and the remedy for unlawfull lust.</p>
            <p>For the first, Comfort of life; The <hi>Chaldees</hi> had a Proverbe, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> either company or death. <hi>Vae soli,</hi> saith the Preacher, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 4. And so saith the Lord, <hi>Gen. 2. It is not good for man to be alone.</hi> And so not onely <hi>Adam</hi> was, but even all men among us, if they be unmarryed, are termed alone men. And therefore the woman is called there, <hi>adjutorium, an helpe.</hi> And that have all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighers against that sex of force confessed, that women at the least are <hi>mala necessaria;</hi> if a wife be an evill, yet a necessary evill. The proverbe hath ranked them among unruly things, but such as mankind may not misse, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Fire, Water, and Women, three e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, but all necessary; at some times harmefull, but at all times need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. But howsoever, some writers, either many ages since, or in these daies, have exercised the vanity of their wits to the disgrace of that sexe; yet Christians must know this: that he that disgraceth the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, dishonoureth his maker. All the workes of God were <hi>good; Gen.</hi> 1. Whereof one, and the chiefest, was man both male and female, <hi>v.</hi> 27. nay they were <hi>very good, v.</hi> 31. man, the Lord over all Creatures, and woman his helper; created with him, and of him; to be his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion in all fortunes; his partner in his joy, his comforter in griefe, his cherisher in sicknesse, his adviser in distresse; the pleasure of his eyes, <hi>Ezechiel</hi> 24. and the spouse of his bosome. <hi>Deutero.</hi> 13. nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer and dearer unto him then his friend, his brother, his child, yea then his parents.</p>
            <p>Thy Brother is but thy mothers sonne, and thy fathers flesh; but thy wife is thy flesh, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. And so the Iewes have a Proverbe, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> a mans wife is his owne body; Saint <hi>Cyrill</hi> calleth her <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of the same flesh with him. I say, thy brother is but thy Parents flesh, but thy wife thine owne, for shee is a ribbe of thy side. Thy friend is but <hi>tanquam
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:173124:279"/> tu Deut.</hi> thy wife not <hi>tanquam,</hi> but <hi>ipsetu,</hi> thy children they are but a drop of thy seede; but thy wife is thy halfe. Thy parents not to be forsaken, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19. but yet rather then thy wife, <hi>Gen. 2. pen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the other side, the man is a mutuall helpe unto the woman; the husband, the wives stay, as being the weaker vessell. What thing so deare unto her, as the child of her wombe? yet the husband better to her then ten children, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 8. yea the two titles, proper unto Christ in regard of the Church, her head and her Saviour; the holy Ghost hath communicated them unto the husband. Hee is the head of his wife, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. as Christ of the Church; and so the wife <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse without man. Nay that which is most honourable, he is his wives Saviour, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 5. 23. as Christ is the Churches. And therefore as the Church taketh the name of Christ, and wee are called Christians; so is it the custome in marriage, the woman to bee called by the name of her husband.</p>
            <p>To shut up this first use; that marriage unto many hath (as the Poet speaketh) <hi>plus aloes, quam mellis,</hi> more bitternesse, then sweete, the fault is not in marriage, but in man. The wife is haply a waspe or a wanton, the husband is haply not sober or not chaste. Marriage of it selfe is a comfort unto man, and that comfort so great, that <hi>Iacob</hi> mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with <hi>Rahel</hi> that should be his wife, through the vehemencie of his joy, burst forth into teares, and was contented for her sake to endure a double prentiship, twice seven yeares service under a churlish ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</p>
            <p>The second use, childbearing: nature hath planted in the beasts, in the birds, in all the brute creatures a desire of young brood for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of their kind. But in man, this desire as proceeding from rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and from God is farre more excellent; and the motives, as moe, so more excellent, the maintenance of mankind, the continuance of their name, the honour of their house, the comfort of their life, the staffe of their age, and that which is the chiefest, the increase of Gods Church, and of the Saints.</p>
            <p>The third use is the remedy of inordinate lust; the sinne the more vile, the more common, the more accurst it is of God, the more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable is marriage that yeeldeth meanes to medecine it. First, man the most excellent creature under heaven, little lower then the Angels, <hi>Psal.</hi> 8. 5. created after Gods owne image, by unlawfull lusting after strange flesh, disparageth his state, and metamorphiseth himselfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a bruite beast: turning, as <hi>Theodoret</hi> speaketh, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Gods likenesse into beasts likenesse; that, that which God sayd ironi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nically, <hi>behold man is become like one of us,</hi> the beasts may say in sad sooth, behold man is become like one of us. And therefore the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in regard of this sinne, applyeth unto man termes borrowed from beasts; as to neigh after women, <hi>Ier.</hi> 5. and compareth them to beasts, <hi>Iudae, ver.</hi> 10. Secondly, whereas sundry other sinnes are for the most part found among the wicked onely; this snareth the holiest of the Saints on earth, and hath surprised the Patriarks, and the chiefest of Gods children. <hi>Lots</hi> incest, <hi>Iudahs</hi> fornication, <hi>Davids</hi> adulterie, are knowne stories in Scripture. Thirdly, the Lord cast a double curse
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:173124:279"/> upon this sinne, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6. 33. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> both a plague, and a reproach, both a stripe and a shame; both on the sinners selfe; the boy pointeth at him in the streete, and the maiden moweth at him in the house; and on his seede, his child, called in disgrace, the sonne of the harlot, and the daughter of adultery. That is for the shame: and for the stripe, it lighteth both upon his person; a passive stripe the parts of the bodie, which the leacher abuseth to his filthy lust, are smitten with loathsome and infectious diseases; and on his posteritie, an active stripe, the base borne child commonly proving a very wicked body, and a plague unto the vertuous. I cannot stand to follow this. Now for the remedy of this foule, common, and accursed sinne, the Lord hath ordained marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age; the man to have his owne wife, and the woman her owne hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</p>
            <p>The rest of the regards, as the examples of holy men, the Lawes of Nations, and sundrie other such, I am forced to omit. These few may suffice for the truth of this Title; let us passe unto the other.</p>
            <p>Hetherto have you heard, how Marriage is Honourable; it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth now to shew it is holy; for what is the meaning of the phrase, <hi>the bed undefiled,</hi> that is, the marriage bed, by a Figure put for Wedlocke, <hi>it is undefiled,</hi> that is, it is holy. The Church hath ever had, even from the Apostles times many vile revilers of the marriage bed. <hi>Saturninus</hi> and <hi>Bafilides</hi> said it came from Sathan; and so did <hi>Tatianus,</hi> as <hi>Theodoret</hi> reporteth, make it the devills ordinance. The <hi>Marcionites</hi> admitted no married folke unto their Sacraments. Nay some shamed not to say, as <hi>Epiphanius</hi> witnesseth, that the woman wholely is the devills worke, and that they which used marriage, wrought the devills craft. Yea some of the learned and ancient Fathers of the Church have beene but heavie friends to marriage. <hi>Origen, Tertullian,</hi> and Saint <hi>Hierom,</hi> have irreverently disgraced it. As for the Papists, how holy doe they hold it, it is apparent by the Priests; whom therefore they permit not for to marrie; because their service is about the holy things. Pope <hi>Syrici<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s</hi> termeth it fleshly pollution. <hi>HIldebrand</hi> preferred whores before wives; fornication, adultery, yea incest it selfe before Matrimonie. Yea some are so shamelesse of that sort, that they will allow the Priest rather <hi>cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum prostibula,</hi> an hundred harlots, than one lawfull wife. And as they hold all marriage impure, so second and third marriage they professe plainely to be <hi>fornicatio, &amp; prostitutio, i.</hi> whoredome and brothelrie. Nay the Iesuits are yet more impudent, who hold the womans sexe to be so wicked, that they spit at the name of them.</p>
            <p>To all these I say in generall, that these are the spirits, of which, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did prophesie many ages since, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. that should forbid to marrie; whose unholy censures of this holy state are there expressely termed the doctrine of devills.</p>
            <p>For the Fathers in particular; <hi>Origen,</hi> his learning mervellous, but his errours perillous. Many of his opinions, Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> calleth <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nata dogmata,</hi> poisonous opinions. And it was said of him, <hi>Quando benè, nemo meliùs, quando malè nemo pijus.</hi> When he did well, no man more excellent; when he did ill, no man more pestilent. Of <hi>Tertullian</hi> I will say no more, than <hi>Hierom</hi> also saith, that he was not <hi>home ecclesiae,</hi> hee
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:173124:280"/> started from the Church, and being malecontent became a Monta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nist. For <hi>Hierom</hi> himselfe; his writings are reverenced in the Church. But that his booke against <hi>I ovinian,</hi> wherein he is so eager against mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, was written in his moode; overmastered with it, he would some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times maintaine some <hi>Paradoxes.</hi> But in his setled judgement he held it holy, as appeareth by sundry other speeches in his books. As for his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons against marriage moe in number, than in waight, no fewer than 56. they are all answered one by one by <hi>Beza,</hi> in his booke of Polygamy.</p>
            <p>The rest of the Censurers of this honourable ordinance, wee are not to respect, because they were Heretickes. As for the Papists, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute themselves; who holding marriage so uncleane a thing, doe yet make it a Sacrament. Now therefore leaving them, that hold it is not holy, it resteth now, I show, that it is holy.</p>
            <p>My first proofe in this point I fetch from the efficient. All the creatures of God, and all his ordinances, they are good, they are san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, they are holy. Marriage Gods owne institution, who is him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe holy, must also be holy. For such as God is, such are all his workes. Yea <hi>the Lord,</hi> saith the <hi>Psalmist, is holy in all his workes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My second proofe is the blessing of the Lord, by which himselfe hath hallowed his Ordinance, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. 1. For the Lord, is not as man, to call good evill, and evill good; but as he curseth nothing that is cleane; so he blesseth nothing that is defiled. The Lord that is himselfe <hi>blessed for ever, benedictus in secula,</hi> blessed to the worlds end, hath blessed mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage from the worlds beginning. And therefore if <hi>Isaac</hi> could say of <hi>Iacob, I have blessed him, and he shall be blessed;</hi> I may say unto the Papists, that reckon marriage a polluted thing, as sometime the voice said unto <hi>Peter, that which God hath hallowed, let not man call unholy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My third reason is from the effect. Marriage, it sanctifieth the man, it sanctifieth the wife, it sanctifieth the children, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. Now as it is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd to looke for grapes of thornes, or figges of thistells, so is it as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable, that any thing should be made holy by that, which is it selfe defiled. Were marriage uncleane, then were it sinne to marrie. But Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith plainely in the same place, that neither the man sinneth, that taketh a wife, neither the woman that marrieth a husband.</p>
            <p>The first Institution of this honourable state, was it not before mans fall, even before there was any uncleane thing in the world? How rash then is the unheedy Papist, to bring pollution into the world, before sinne began? For that must needes follow, that if marriage be uncleane, be polluted, be sinne, as some of them write, then <hi>Adam</hi> sinned, in his perfect state, he sinned before the fall, he sinned before he sinned.</p>
            <p>Shall I presse this point yet further, and show the marriage bed to be unspotted, by Types and by Testimonies? What meant the ancient Heathens to beare before the Bride, Fire and Water; but to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie Puritie? Water the washer of all uncleane things, and Fire the trier of all impure things: And what meanes now in marriage the Ring among us Christians? But to represent the holy duties betweene the married parties? The Ring is one, not many, put on the fourth finger, the figure round, and the metall gold: to teach them that their love, it must be single, it must be heartie, it must be endlesse, and it must be pure. That is for Type.</p>
            <pb n="523" facs="tcp:173124:280"/>
            <p>Now for Testimonies; <hi>Dionysius</hi> of <hi>Halycarnassa,</hi> a Heathen Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian calleth it <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, holy Wedlocke; and the <hi>Iewes</hi> terme marriage, <hi>Kiddushin,</hi> that is holy things. What cite I Iewes and Gentiles? The learnedest, the antientest, the precisest of the Fathers, <hi>Ignatius,</hi> Saint <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> S. <hi>Austine,</hi> and many others avouch as much as our Apostle? Doth the Pope himselfe charge marriage with Pollution? <hi>Ignatius</hi> answers him, that who shall say, that lawfull Wedlocke is a thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, <hi>Hospitem habet Draconem Apostatam,</hi> Sathan is within him, and hee is Host unto the devill. Doth the Papist presse yet further, that marriage is uncleane, because it is unchast; and that Virginity is the onely chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie? Saint <hi>Austin</hi> answers that, that there is <hi>Castitas conjugalis,</hi> as well as <hi>virginalis,</hi> chastitie in Wedlocke, as well as in Maidenhood.</p>
            <p>To shut up this point; marriage may be made unholy, but it selfe is not unholy. There is no holy thing, but mans profanenesse may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hallow it. Marriage is holy, as it was by God ordained, but it is unho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as it is by man abused. The wayes are many to unhallow it, the nonage of the parties, the forcing of their wills, the non-consent of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, the matching in degrees prohibited, or with infidells, things common, but unchristian; [all these, waightie points, are worth the prosecution, and very behofefull in these presumptuous dayes; but the time neither serveth to perfit this point, or to proceede unto the next.] All these, and more than these, which I cannot stand to prosecure, disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour this honourable-ordinance of God, and pollute and defile this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled state. But of it self it is a chast, it is a pure, it is an holy institution; the Author holy that ordained it, the parties holy that received it; and now not to be made among us that be Christians, but by an holy person, and in an holy place. And therefore I conclude, that Matrimony is San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctimony; that <hi>marriage is honourable, and the bed is undefiled.</hi>

I must begin with it. First, <hi>what</hi> craves hee? and then why? I pray your patience, Gods assistance. Gods name <hi>Iehova,</hi> and the word of time, lye <hi>in aequilibrio,</hi> indifferent, whether to the reason, or the prayer. Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stations point them diversely; the Hebrew accent swayes them, layes them to the prayer. I omit them both. The one here hath small <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phasis,</hi> the other, <hi>Iehova,</hi> hath beene often here expounded. [As for the doctrine, it here offers, that <hi>Prayer is proper unto God onely,</hi> it is a
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:173124:281"/> beaten argument.] The Petition is compendious; show who can a shorter, <hi>take my soule.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By <hi>soule,</hi> he meanes not his spirit, but his life. The word in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture meanes so mostly. A strange Petition. To beseech God, at point of death to take the soule, <hi>i.</hi> the spirit, every man ought. Saint <hi>Steven</hi> did, Christs selfe did. But to pray him, take my life, I may not. It is a strange prayer of a Prophet. I must preserve my life; nature bids me. God doth. That nature bids, the brute creature showes, which will not dye, if it may choose; will strive to live, what it is able. God bids more; made man immortall, to live ever, would have him like to God in that. So was hee, till he fell. But though sinne subject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to death; yet dye wee must not, till God call. Mans spirit is Gods gift. Life both comes in, and goes out with the soule. It is man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, if a man give me a gift, to give it him againe? God gave it me, to doe him service: shall I serve him no longer then I list? <hi>Dominus dedit, Dominus abstulit,</hi> God gave, and God must take away; but not till him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe will.</p>
            <p>Not bruite creatures alone, man too, the naturall man will not dye, if he may choose. <hi>Skin for skin,</hi> saith Sathan; a man for his life will indure any thing. <hi>Mecoenas</hi> was wont to say, <hi>Debilem facito pede, debilem facito manu,</hi> have foot-goute, hand-goute, hippe-goute, the Sciatica; <hi>vita dum superest, bene est,</hi> he cared not, so he lived. <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> in cowardise wisht death, drunke poyson to worke it: but instant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repenting, cast it up againe. Twas but one mans opinion, a strickt Philosopher, that death is, <hi>Naturae Inventum optimum,</hi> the best thing meerely, that nature ever devised. Who ere sayd so, but <hi>Seneca?</hi> A man (I yeeld) learned and wise. But by his learnings leave, tis against all Philosophie, to make death, natures devise. Nature hates nothing more. As learned and as wise a man, as he, calls life <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

Death is a blessing, I deny not; <hi>mori, lucrum,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> twas gaine to him to dye. But to desire to dye, that to be lawfull, I deny, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in a Prophet. A Prophet to aske in prayer, what he ought not? A man of God? So hee is cald often. <hi>David</hi> did not so, a Prophet too. <hi>I will not dye, but live,</hi> saith hee. Why will yee dye, saith another Prophet, twas <hi>Ezechiel. Ieremie</hi> saith so too, <hi>quare morieris? why wilt thou dye? Paul</hi> indeede an Apostle, and so a Prophets peere at least, desired to be dissolved. Thats but <hi>votum,</hi> not <hi>precatio,</hi> a wish, no prayer. I doe not simply condemne desire of death; but desire of it in prayer. <hi>Pauls</hi> was an holy wish, to be with Christ; a lust, he termes it, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, A lust so longing, that it makes him speake <hi>incongruè, multò magis meli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Phil.</hi> 1. 23. But he made it not his prayer; did not petition God, to bee dissolved. Nay, he corrected that wish instantly with a better de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, to live to preach the Gospell. His wish was but comparative.
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:173124:282"/>
               <hi>Paul</hi> set not life so light, to wish death simply. Why appealed he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Caesar,</hi> but to scape death? used policie at another time, set the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees and Saducees at jarre to escape too; sent another time to the Captaine to bee rescued from the Iewes, who purposed to have slaine him. Surely tis height of happinesse to bee with Christ. But let mee doe my worke before I aske my wages. It is <hi>Magis melius,</hi> better to preach Christ, then to be with Christ. If I be with Christ, I shall bee glorified; but if I preach Christ, God shall be glorified. <hi>Woe be unto me if I preach not the Gospel.</hi> I will preach him while I live; and when I dye, I will pray to be with him. I will then say with <hi>Elias, Now O Lord take my soule.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What then thus made this man of God to make this Prayer? For so this is, not <hi>votum,</hi> but <hi>precatio;</hi> not a desire onely, in the clause be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my Text; but bee <hi>sayd, i.</hi> hee prayed; not <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> wisht not onely, craved it too, <hi>Now O Lord take my soule.</hi> Yea it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse in the originall. Tis in English, he desired, but in Hebrew, hee petitioned. But why? what ayles hee? It must be some great passion that transports him. So it is. Hee is a man of God; but yet a man. A Prophet, but <hi>yet subject</hi> (as Saint <hi>Iames</hi> saith) <hi>to the like passions with us.</hi> The Queene had threatned his death, sworne it. He flyes for feare; travells, and is weary; hungry too, it seemes; faint both in body, and heart too, he prayes God hee may dye, dye presently, <hi>Now, O Lord take my soule. David</hi> saith in the <hi>Psalme, O tarry the Lords leasure.</hi> Hee will not; but will dye instantly, <hi>Tolle nunc.</hi> Moe Prophets besides him, have beene weake thus. <hi>Moses</hi> was before him; <hi>Ionas</hi> after him. <hi>Moses</hi> in his greefe cryed to God, <hi>I pray thee, kill me. Ionas</hi> in his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger will needs dye, prayes it heartily, <hi>Ion.</hi> 4. 8. reasons too there, as <hi>Elias</hi> doth here; <hi>It is better for him, to dye then to live:</hi> argues wisely; he could tell what was best for him, better then God.</p>
            <p>Thus even Prophets themselves speake in their passion unadvisedly. Many good men in their impatiencie mutine against God; and in the weakenesse of their spirits, shrinke under their crosse, and desire to be dissolved before their day of death; not wish it onely, worke it too sometimes untimely and unkindly. But to pray to dye, at least to wish it, many a crosse will force a good Christian. A sonne is one, a <hi>Cain,</hi> a <hi>Cham,</hi> an <hi>Ismael,</hi> an <hi>Esau,</hi> a gracelesse, lawlesse, incorrigible son will force a father to desire to dye. If <hi>Iosephs</hi> death will make <hi>Iacob</hi> rend his cloathes, mourne so, that all his sonnes shall not bee able, daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters too, to comfort him, yea to cry out, <hi>surely I will goe downe unto my sonne into the grave sorrowing:</hi> a sonne, lost to God, thats worse then dead, especially if the first borne of his father, and brought up care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, will force him, ought not, but it will; not to pray onely as <hi>Elias</hi> did, to dye, but to dye indeede; not to say onely, as old <hi>Iacob</hi> did, I will goe downe, but to goe downe indeede with sorrow into the grave. This is one crosse; tormenting paines another. What neede I cite ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny particulars? Extreme misery will make <hi>Iob</hi> to cry, <hi>Taedet animam meam vitae meae.</hi> All this will worke pitty to the Prophets case; but it warrants not his act. Hee cryes, <hi>sufficit,</hi> to God; but this is no <hi>suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit</hi> to him. Heare therefore one thing more for his Apologie.</p>
            <pb n="527" facs="tcp:173124:282"/>
            <p>I will not thinke <hi>Elias</hi> so faint hearted to feare death. For hee durst not then have affronted <hi>Ahab</hi> so, when he askt him, If it were hee, that <hi>troubled Israel,</hi> to tell him, not was <hi>he.</hi> He might have a stout spirit, that will answer a King so. It must have cost him haply his head. It was not that. He were not heartlesse, senselesse rather, to flye from death, and pray to dye. It is sayd the verse before, he fled for his life: and prayes he God in this, to take his life? Hee to whom God gave power to shut and open heaven, to raine or hold up at his pleasure, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand fire from heaven, to raise the dead, feares he to dye? I cannot tell. You heard Saint <hi>Iames</hi> subject him to our passions. <hi>Peter</hi> so cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious, as to dare draw a sword on a band of armed men, a silly maids question made him turne dastard, and deny Christ. Haply <hi>Iezebel</hi> had daunted the Prophet more then the King. Shee had threatned him, hee had not, had vowed his death with impecation. Yet will I not censure <hi>Elias</hi> for all this. I thinke it was not death, he feared, but the kind of death, the fowlest likely the Queene could devise. The kind of death is often worse then death. Thats not all.</p>
            <p>I thinke the zealous Prophet respected more Gods glory, then his life. To dye, he cared not; but dye he would not by a woman, an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatresse: he would not fall by the hand of <hi>Baals</hi> worshippers. Then should God be dishonoured in his death; <hi>Baal</hi> should triumph over God. He prayes <hi>him,</hi> take his life; he would not have <hi>them</hi> have it: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore addes the Adverbe, <hi>Now, Now O Lord, take my soule.</hi> So <hi>Saul</hi> would have his armour bearer slay him rather, would rather, he refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, slay himselfe, fall on his owne sword, then the <hi>Philistims</hi> should kill him, Gods enemies. Had <hi>Elias</hi> this religious sweete conceipt; <hi>minus peccatum habet,</hi> his sin was very veniall. In so short a Prayer why am I so long? To end it, life is let thee by God, let, I say, not lent. Were it lent, thou mightst pay it, when thou wouldest, as soone I meane, as thou wouldst. But it is let thee by God; but without lease; no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine terme; thou arttenant at will, I meane Gods will, not thine owne. Thou must leave it, <hi>when</hi> he will; but thou must hold it, till he will; not keepe it longer, nor leave it sooner. Thou must goe, when God cryes, <hi>Come againe yee sonnes of men.</hi> But if Christ will have thee stay till hee come; what is that to thee? And so <hi>Elias</hi> doth, hee stayes Christs comming, is not dead yet. <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> live unto this day, and shall untill Christ come.</p>
            <p>You have heard the prayer, heare the reasons. But a word of the first, because it is no more; and yet it is enough. <hi>Quod satis est, sufficit:</hi> thats the first reason, <hi>sufficit, it is enough.</hi> What is enough? Enough that he hath lived till now, and thats the next word here, <hi>Now O Lord take my soule. Enough,</hi> that long enough. How long? Scripture tells not; tells where he was borne, not when. So is <hi>Elias</hi> like <hi>Melchisedek,</hi> of whom <hi>Paul</hi> saith to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> his dayes had no beginning, nor his life end. He meanes neither was recorded in Gods booke. How long <hi>Elias</hi> had lived, wee know not. Hee saith here, <hi>long enough.</hi> A mans age, <hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>is threescore yeares and ten.</hi> Haply so long. Sometimes ten more in a stronge and hole body. Say, so long. Some Hebrew writers say, <hi>Elias</hi> was <hi>Phinees,</hi> sonne to <hi>Eleezar Acrons</hi> sonne.
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:173124:283"/> Then had hee lived long indeede, 500. yeares. None in those dayes lived a quarter of that age. A Iewish fable. <hi>Elias</hi> and <hi>Phinees</hi> were not of one Tribe. But were his yeares never so many; yet ought hee not say, <hi>Sufficit.</hi> God must say it, not Man. God metes to every man his terme, gives him that length of life, he lists; to some an hundred yeares, to some not halfe an hundred dayes, not halfe halfe hundred houres. The shortest life is long enough; the longest is no more. The babe that dies unborne, dies not untimely, lives out his full stint, hath Gods <hi>Sufficit.</hi> Fulnesse of dayes is old age in Scripture phrase. But the shortest liver hath fulnesse of dayes too, Gods fulnesse. Hee hath lived long enough, that hath done all that service, God appointed him. Who can tell, when he hath done that? No man is so old, (once <hi>Seneca</hi> said) <hi>Vt improbè speret unum diem,</hi> but he may honestly hope to live one day more. God may have some thing for him to doe, even on that day, on that one day. Let him crie never, <hi>tis enough. Elias</hi> ought not, hee had much worke of Gods to doe, he knew not of. He was to anoint two Kings, and one Prophet. Hee must denounce destruction to <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Iezebel,</hi> death to <hi>Ahaziah;</hi> call for fire from heaven to consume two Captaines with their fifties, and to divide <hi>Iordan.</hi> Tis not yet time to crie, <hi>Sufficit, It is enough.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One of this Prophets worth would not have every word sifted too neere. Hee might meane haply well. He had lived long enough, <hi>Satis naturae</hi> in regard of his yeares, which (it seemes) were many, as many, as his ancestors before him. Might it so please the Lord, to whom hee prayed, he had lived long enough. Not as loath yet to labour further in Gods cause. But he haply felt his spirits spent. The peoples impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie had teazd his soule, and his toile and travell tired his body. Long life is a blessing, age a crowne of glory. For that (I doubt not) he was thankefull. But misery might make him crie with <hi>Iob. Taedet animam meam vitae meae, my soule is wearie of my life.</hi> If it pleased God, <hi>Sufficit,</hi> he had lived long enough. Fire cries not <hi>Sufficit, Solomon</hi> saith, never saith, <hi>Enough.</hi> Youth is fierie hot, and loves life. But that fire is out in age; and old <hi>Elias</hi> will crie <hi>Sufficit, tis enough.</hi> Surely it should seeme by the Chapter next before, that he was firie hot. He had newly slaine moe than 400. men, <hi>Baals</hi> Prophets all, with his owne hands, for ought I find there. There, like the fire, he nere cried <hi>Sufficit,</hi> he spared not one. But Gods fire was in that Act: not onely on the sacrifice from heaven, but in the Prophets heart, from Gods Spirit. Cold he might be by age; but he was hot by zeale; <hi>Zeale</hi> signifieth heat: and in that firie heat he wrought that Act. If with his owne hands, it might well weary all his aged limbes, and make him the more to crie <hi>Sufficit,</hi> tis <hi>enough.</hi> Yea and haply his <hi>Sufficit</hi> lookes backe unto that Act, meanes not his age, but <hi>Baals</hi> Prophets. He had rescued Religion from Idolatrie, slaine all the Idoll Prophets. <hi>Baal</hi> was confounded, and the people cried, <hi>The Lord, he is God, the Lord, he is God. Sufficit,</hi> that was <hi>Enough.</hi> Enough of <hi>Sufficit;</hi> come to the other Reason, <hi>I am no better, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How farre doth one mans spirit differ from anothers? One Prophets spirit from anothers? <hi>Ionas</hi> desired to die, as <hi>Elias</hi> doth, but not in that spirit, that <hi>Elias</hi> doth. <hi>Ionas</hi> moodile and frowardly, <hi>Elias</hi> sweetly and
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:173124:283"/> humbly. <hi>Ionas</hi> should be the Dove; so his name signifies. But <hi>Elias</hi> is indeede, gentle, and meeke. <hi>Ionas</hi> wrangles with God. <hi>Elias</hi> reasons too, but with humilitie. <hi>Ionas</hi> preferred his credit before the lives of all the men of <hi>Nineveh. Elias</hi> will not be better, than his Fathers. Where is his spirit now? What sonne is now, strives not at least to be better then his Father? then all his ancestors? <hi>Rehoboams</hi> little finger is stronger than his Fathers loines, who though bred in the dust, deemes not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe worthy to sit with Princes? A point too tender, to applie. Let e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man imitate the Prophets humilitie, and remember the rocke, out of which he was hewen. Strive not to outstrippe thy Ancestors in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, but in vertue and grace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I am not</hi> (saith the Prophet) <hi>better than my Fathers.</hi> Who are they? Heres <hi>Melchizedech</hi> againe, without Father, without mother. Scripture reckons none. You will reply, it doth; for <hi>Elias</hi> was <hi>Phinees,</hi> the Iewes say; and <hi>Phinees</hi> Father and Grandfather are there. I answer; first, it is a fable. Secondly, say he was <hi>Phinees,</hi> whose Father is recorded. So was <hi>Melchisedech. Melchisedech</hi> was <hi>Sem,</hi> Hebrew Writers say, and <hi>Sems</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is in Scripture; he was <hi>Noahs</hi> sonne, and <hi>Noah Lamechs</hi> son. But <hi>Sem</hi> under that name, the name of <hi>Melchisedech,</hi> hath no Genealogie. Thinke the like of <hi>Elias.</hi> Who his Forefathers were, wee doe not reade, nor doth it skill. Most Prophets came of meane Progenitors. Marke this Prophets spirit, stout in Gods cause, humble in his owne; makes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in his modestie, no better than his Fathers, meane, it should seeme by the Scriptures silence. Men of name are lightly named. They were low, he is no higher, no whit better than they.</p>
            <p>I would not presse the pride of many sonnes, ashamed of their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors to shunne offence. That touch would seeme too personall, and some would haply say, such an one so. I will lay my charge more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall. In some things (saith S. <hi>Iames</hi>) we offend all, in many things. This one. Apply it, if you please; but be not partiall. No man needes looke on others; tis himselfe, every man is so. Who is not better than his neighbour, thinkes himselfe so, in worth, in parts, in zeale, in under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing? We taxe the womans sexe, as weake this way. It is, I may not flatter; but thats but mostly in precedencie. <hi>Men</hi> areso, every way, every man. Every soule is sowred with that leven of the Pharisee, <hi>I thank God I am not as other men are.</hi> It is true, for I am worse. Every mans penny is of finer silver, than his fellowes; his defects fewer, his deserts moe than his, for preferment, for imployment, for advancement, for what not? Fitter than he. Learn this Prophets lesson, alter but one word, for Fathers, put in Brethren. Say every man, every woman, to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, of themselves, I am no better than my brethren. God will like thee better, man will love thee more. Not God onely, but man too, every man, loathes a proud person. I leave this; tis but <hi>Aloes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Looke we backe to <hi>Elias;</hi> he is <hi>no better</hi> (he saith) <hi>then his Fathers.</hi> Thats his humilitie, to underprise himselfe. He saith, <hi>he is not;</hi> but hee is. Shall I show you how? Tis fit, hee be exalted, that thus humbles himselfe. Very excellent things are spoken of thee, O thou man of God. Be that first, a man of God, an eminent appellation; higher than a Prophet. <hi>Moses</hi> was the first called so, <hi>Samuel</hi> the next, then <hi>David,</hi>
               <pb n="530" facs="tcp:173124:284"/> the next, then <hi>David,</hi> very few more. <hi>Rector</hi> of the Colledge of the Prophets in his time. Out of whose schoole came that Oracle in the <hi>Talmud,</hi> that the world should last sixe thousand yeares, two before the Law, two under it, and two after it. An affronter of Kings in Gods cause. A destroyer of <hi>Balls</hi> Priests. A worker of great miracles; divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Iordan</hi> with his mantell, stayed heaven from raining three yeares and sixe moneths, raised the dead, the widdowes sonne of <hi>Sarepta,</hi> said to be <hi>Ionas</hi> the Prophet; fasted like Christ and <hi>Moses</hi> fortie dayes, fed by an Angell, by Ravens morning and evening. His Spirit in <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist, the greatest man (Christs selfe said) among the sonnes of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. He, and <hi>Moses</hi> thought worthy to conferre with Christ in his glory on mount <hi>Thabor.</hi> But which transcends all honor done any man, save Christ, taken up to heaven, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in his body, <hi>Epiph. Enoch</hi> was translated; but how, wee read not. <hi>Elias</hi> was, like Christ, visibly, in a charet of fire went up to heaven, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               </gap>, surnamed God for his greatnesse, saith a Greeke Father; whom God thus magnified, vilifies himselfe, saith here, <hi>Non sum me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lior, I am no better than my Fathers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To end this and All, his humility is admirable, but his Reason not allowable, God gives us All his Spirit; but his Argument is weake. What <hi>Elias</hi> was, compared to his Progenitors, better or worse then they, for condition, or for grace, it skils not to his Prayer. Were hee greater then his Fathers, were he lesse it will not follow either way, that God must take his Soule. Death lookes at no mans state. <hi>Seneca</hi> saith wittily, <hi>Non citamur ex censu,</hi> death doth not summon us by the subsidie booke. Sit I, like <hi>Iob</hi> in ashes, or like <hi>Solomon,</hi> in a throne, God will take my Soule, if he thinke good, will not, unlesse he please; and will, when he will, will not, till then. Tis neither <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> spake, any mans more betternesse, nor <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, his more meaner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, that God lookes at. Why he takes one Soule, one houre old on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, why not another, till an hundred yeares of age, he knowes, not we, and therefore I may not cry <hi>Sufficit, tis enough,</hi> the Prophets first reason. Why he takes the better, leaves the worse, or takes the worse, and leaves the better; he knowes that too, not we. And therefore I may not cry neither with <hi>Elias, Lord take my Soule; for I am not better, then my Fathers.</hi> I will not sing with <hi>Simeon, Lord, now let thy Servant depart in peace according to thy word.</hi> He had the Spirits warrant to sing so. And thus have I as breefely and perspicuously as I could handled the former branch of the Man of Gods Prayer; to wit, that the Lord would be pleased to take away his life, together with his reasons; wherein I have shewed you the strangnesse of this his request; as being both against nature, religion, &amp;c. Against nature, for the brute crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture will not dye if he may choose: against religion, for God made us to serve and to glorifie him: and life is Gods gift; and to give it him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, argues unmannerlinesse, and not to serve him, as long as we may, argues ungratefulnesse: as also the weakenesse of his reasons: as if he could tell what were better for him then God; who is the Almighty, and puts a <hi>sufficit</hi> to every thing when he pleases: My Prayer shall be
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:173124:284"/> onely, Lord, let thy humble Servant depart in peace according to thy will. Lord, let me, let us all, at the instant of death, put <hi>Nunc</hi> too to <hi>Dimittis,</hi> say all this Prophets Prayer, <hi>Now, O Lord, take my Soule:</hi> but till then, with patience possesse our soules, say, but at the most, as Christ did, <hi>Not my will, Father, but thy will be done.</hi> The Lord, the lover of Soules, at the happy houre of his appointed time, take all our Soules. The Lord <hi>Iesus</hi> receive them then; the holy Ghost comfort them till then; to all which sacred Persons of the blessed Trinity, be joyntly ascribed, <hi>All honour glory, &amp;c.</hi>

The wise man cryes then to it, <hi>Quid superbis terra &amp; cinis?</hi> why art thou proud, thou Dust and Ashes? The lownesse of our mould must humble the highnesse of our minde. God put in mans name a marke of his materialls: what is <hi>Adam</hi> but Earth? <hi>Homo ab humo.</hi>

            <p>Me thinkes I heare one answer, the <hi>Preacher</hi> doth us wrong. <hi>Adam</hi> indeede was earth, God made his body of it; but his onely. All other issue from the wombs of women spring from the loynes of men, so are flesh and blood, not Dust. Proud clay-clod, wilt thou teach Gods Spirit to speake? and whom makest thou thy selfe? art thou better then <hi>Abraham?</hi> Hee cryed to God, <hi>Pulvis &amp; cinis ego,</hi> hee was but Dust and Ashes. He was? We are, we are all, <hi>David</hi> saith. The migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiest Monarch is of no better mould. The Cynick sayd it to <hi>Alexanders</hi> selfe, that Kings are Gods on earth; but they are but Gods of earth. The goodliest man, but <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

Sayd not <hi>Anaxagoras,</hi> snow was blacke? Thinke you he was so madde to call white black? No, but hee considered the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of the water, when it resolved; he meant snow melted. Mans bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is indeed, blood, flesh and bone. The <hi>Genesis</hi> is so; but the <hi>Analysis</hi> is earth. A Corpse kept above ground many yeares, or in drye mould in grave, touch it, you shall finde it powder, meere dust. Let a Poet (with your favour) expound a Preacher once, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, saith <hi>Phocylides,</hi> bodyes resolved are ashes all. To end this, bee <hi>Salomons</hi> word here Dust, eyther as the first mans substance, or as all mens end; wee are both vile and fraile. Make wee but that use of it; and I leave it. <hi>Verbum sapienti;</hi> I goe on, <hi>And Dust returne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Termes have returnes; so hath mans life. For thats a terme, <hi>termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus vitae,</hi> the terme of life, an usuall terme. Man hath two returnes, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> one; the other is Death. <hi>Returne, returne,</hi> saith the Prophet, <hi>i.</hi> turne from your sinnes. [That returne is proper to the righteous.] <hi>Returne yee sonnes of men;</hi> thats meant of death, [and is generall to all] <hi>Salomon</hi> meanes that here. <hi>Obitus</hi> is <hi>Reditus,</hi> Death is meere Returne. That Returne is here twice; first of the Body, then of the Spirit.</p>
            <p>For the former, mans life is a pilgrimage, old <hi>Iacobs</hi> terme, <hi>Davids</hi> too. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calls us, Saint <hi>Peter</hi> too, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

The vulgar Latin I like not, <hi>domus aeternitatis,</hi> our everlasting home. It is not so: that denyes the resurrection. The Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish is better, our long home. The travelour at the end of his journey
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:173124:286"/> returnes home. The body first sprung from the earth, and the soule first issued from the Lord, both meete in man, and live lovingly toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all the dayes of mans pilgrimage. That ended, each returnes to his first founder. Life is but a Loane; God lent it us; It must be repaid. <hi>Debemur morti,</hi> we are owne to dye.</p>
            <p>The terme next following hath affinitie with this; take wee that to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> it. Whether must the Dust returne? to the <hi>earth,</hi> as it was. <hi>Dust it was, and to Dust it must goe; Ashes to Ashes.</hi> Man is <hi>Microcosmus,</hi> a little world. The worlds motion is circular, <hi>ab eodem puncto ad idem,</hi> from Dust to Earth. Man is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap> from the earth, saith <hi>David,</hi> and to earth hee must returne. It seemed to <hi>Nicodemus</hi> an absurditie, that an old man should goe againe into his mothers wombe, and it was so in his sense. It is not so in <hi>Salomons.</hi> It is an old man he here speakes of, a decrepite aged man. He saith, he must goe into his mothers wombe againe. He must, all must, old and young when God cryes, <hi>Reverti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini.</hi> The earth is the mother of us all, <hi>Sirac.</hi> From her we came, and shee lookes for us againe. God hath appointed her that bore us, to bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry us; her wombe must entombe us.</p>
            <p>To the earth, as it was? Is not <hi>Salomon</hi> deceived? All goe not to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> grave: some perish in the Aire; Fire consumes some. Fishes, Fowles, wilde Beasts doe devoure many. The Dogges did <hi>Iezabel,</hi> Beares 42. boyes in <hi>Bethel.</hi> All these for all this returne unto the earth. Or bee such excepted, the Preacher meanes <hi>utplurimum,</hi> most bodies doe. Yea where Scripture saith, All; yet even there sometimes are some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.

            </p>
            <p>The former was almost <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, confest of all men, a sensible <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> truth; needs no dispute, tis obvious to the eye, to every eye. Wee all see all men, mortall: The latter hath some knots; wee shall loose them, as we light on them, (<hi>and the spirit returne to God.</hi>) Mans soule hath his Returne, as well as his body. They were in life (as it were) wedded together. Death divorceth them. The body the soules Iayle, <hi>Tullies</hi> terme, <hi>Carcer Animae;</hi> death delivers it. Man gives up his Ghost, yeelds his spirit; its free from him, and it goes. But the going is returning, Dust and the spirit Returne both.</p>
            <p>The Atheist denyes that, and the Sadducee. They hold the soule perisheth, mans soule like the beasts. For they differ not, a mans soule from a swines, one mad hereticke sayd, <hi>Manes.</hi> One Pope once doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the soules immortalitie, Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> 22. Indeed tis not exprest in any Christian Creede: but it is implyed in all; almost in every Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle. Christ ascended not, rose not, dyed not, was not borne, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, if mens soules perish like beasts. For why was Christ incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, but for the soules salvation? Theres no Saints, no Resurrection, no life everlasting, if soules perish. An opinion which gives leave to all kind of licentiousnesse. What will a wicked man not dare doe in his life, that thinkes he shall not suffer for it after death? If the spirit ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; cancell the Creede: rase all religion; for <hi>Animae causa omnis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligio
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:173124:286"/> est, Augustine.</hi> This conceit is meere Heathenisme.</p>
            <p>But there is another among Christians, that the soule indeede dies not, but it sleepes, sleepes till the resurrection. The heresie termed by Divines <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, antiently held in <hi>Arabia,</hi> and revived lately by some Anabaptists. <hi>Calvin</hi> hath written a large and learned tract against these dreamers. The deceased soule sleepes not: but eyther suffers paines in hell, which will not let it sleepe, or sings in heaven a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall <hi>Hallelujah,</hi> which requires waking too. It <hi>Returnes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what if Scripture say nay? The wise man saith, the spirit returnes not, <hi>exit spiritus, &amp; non revertitur, Sap.</hi> 16. If we answer, thats <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crypha, David</hi> sath it too, <hi>Psal.</hi> 78. wrested Scriptures both, they meane not this Returning. The wise man meanes, that the soule departed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes not to the body, that a dead man revives not. And <hi>David</hi> meanes mans breath, not his soule. His breath from mouth or nostrils once gone forth, comes not backe againe; It runnes out into the ayre, and there vanisheth. Goe wee on to the next terme; the spirit Returnes, but whether? <hi>To God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The body and soule in life were <hi>individu's,</hi> unseparable companions, went alwayes together. Why not also in Death? A question not worth answer. Two friends will walke all day together, but at night will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne each to his owne home. The soules home is heaven, the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous soules; the bodyes is the grave, the earth. But saith not the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> that the spirit returnes to the earth too? <hi>Psal. 146. spiritus exit, &amp; revertitur ad terram suam,</hi> speakes (to appearance) punctually. <hi>Ad terram, &amp; ad terram suam,</hi> to the earth, to his owne earth; hee both saith, it returnes to it, and also, tis his home. To a rash reader it may seeme so: but waigh the words well, and they meane no such matter. It is indeede in the vulgar, <hi>egredietur &amp; revertetur.</hi> But both words are not meant of the same subject: both verbes have not the same nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive case. Tis the spirit, that goeth forth, but tis the dead man, the corpse, that returnes to his earth. Tis obscure in the Latin, but plaine in the originall; so plaine, that no scholler can mistake it, and the English is indifferent plaine, He returneth; not, It returneth not. It, the spirit, but He, the man, the dead man, thats the body.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The spirit returnes to God;</hi> hee meanes the just mans spirit. For the wicked mans goes to <hi>Abaddon,</hi> to <hi>Gehenna.</hi> The Preacher addes not that: twas odious. Or say, he meanes the sinners soule also: It returnes too to God, to receive sentence. Haply Angels, one or moe, bring it before God, and he bids, <hi>tradite tortoribus,</hi> goe and deliver it to the tormentours. Some Iewish writers conceive so. O the riches, the exceeding riches of Gods grace, that calls the soule of a misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble sinner up unto himselfe: Loved it so, while man lived, that he dwelt with it on earth, while it had a house there; dislog'd thence, assumes it to himselfe into heaven, to dwell with him! God, and a just mans soule will ever cohabite. <hi>Ruth</hi>

            <p>Theres a great Philosopher cryes, <hi>non credo,</hi> to this, <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> a

               </gap> transmigration of soules.

               </gap>, a boy, a girle, a shrub, a foule, and a fish. Some Iewish writers say, that a righteous mans soule hath three devolutions, a wicked mans immediately goes into a Beast, and at last becomes a devill. <hi>Adams</hi> soule was afterward in <hi>David,</hi> and againe in Christ. That they finde in <hi>Adams</hi> name, in their Cabalisticall subtiltie. <hi>A.</hi> means <hi>Adam, D. David, M. Messias.</hi> This Pythagorian Gull, as one Philosopher founded it, so another hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded it. <hi>Seneca,</hi> as wise a man as ere <hi>Pythagoras</hi> was, sayd, <hi>Sursum vocant illam Initia sua,</hi> the soules beginning calls it up to God; and thats the last thing in my Text, to God <hi>that gave it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The lover of soules, Gods Epithet, <hi>Sap.</hi> 11. <hi>ult.</hi> is here the giver of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> soules. What a noble creature is man? wholy Gods workemanship. <hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>Minorasti, thou hast lessened him, paulo minorasti, a little lessend him below the Angels.</hi> May not I say, <hi>Majorasti,</hi> thou hast gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him, <hi>multò majorasti,</hi> much graced him above the Angels. God made them but with his word, but <hi>Adam</hi> with his hands. Yea which I ghesse more gracefull, <hi>Adams</hi> soule with his breath. When Christ bad his Disciples, Receive the holy Ghost, hee layd not his hands on them, but breathed on them. Mans body was <hi>Manus Dei,</hi> his soule <hi>Afflatus Dei, Tertul.</hi> Gods hand framed <hi>Adams</hi> body; his breath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired his soule. Saint <hi>Austin</hi> seconds <hi>Tertullian,</hi> calls the soule, <hi>Flatum Dei,</hi> Gods breath the soules first generation, was Gods immediate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration, saith a Bishop, sometime of this Church. <hi>Caelestis origo, Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil</hi> could say, it comes from heaven. Mans spirit, Gods gift.</p>
            <p>Would you thinke the Preacher had opposers in this point? Hee hath many. If Heathens onely, twere no marvaile; they consult Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, not Faith, Nature, not Scripture. But Christians crosse it too, say, mans soule is <hi>ex traduce,</hi> by propagation, like the body; comes from the parents, not from God; bred from them, not given by him; not Created, but Begotten. A prophane and grosse assertion; yet hath many maintainers, mighty too, the greater part (Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> saith) of the Latin Fathers. <hi>Aquinas</hi> for all that saith, it is flat heresie. The Catholick <hi>Tenet</hi> is, that when the body is fully fashioned in the womb, then God puts the soule in it. Not that all soules were created toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the first, as <hi>Origen</hi> held. But God then makes them, when hee gives them, <hi>Creando infundit, &amp; infundendo creat,</hi> makes, and gives them at once.</p>
            <p>The opposite opinion is both base and absurd. Base, that such a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance as mans soule, so divine and angelicall, should be bred <hi>ex sper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate.</hi> Debase the body, to abate mans pride, as much as you please. Be it <hi>sperma foetidum,</hi> as Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> termes it. But disgrace not the spirit, the noblest, next the Angels, of all creatures. Absurd, that a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible body should be able to beget an incorruptible spirit. Or if you
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:173124:287"/> will reply, tis the soule begets the soule, thats as absurd. Spirits beget not one another: not onely not Angels, but not soules neither. It agrees not (saith Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi>) with soules, <hi>ut vel generent, vel generentur,</hi> eyther to beget, or to be begotten. Will you say they doe, or may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and that the childs soule comes from the parents? Then either from the mans alone, or from the womans, or from both. If from the mans; whence then was Christs, who had no father? If from the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; whence then was <hi>Eves,</hi> who had no mother? If from both; then are there Twinnes: for each soule must have his issue. Againe, if my parents give me my soule from theirs: eyther they give mee their whole soules, and so have none themselves; or they give me but part; and then the soule is <hi>Secabile,</hi> a grosse absurditie. Spirits having no quantitie, admit no partition. I love not to be long upon one point; I am forced to be in this. For the Reasons on the adverse part would not be slighted. I will cite but one or two of the most waightie.</p>
            <p>One threatens our salvation. Woe bee to our soules, saith one, if Christ tooke not his soule, his humane spirit, as well as his body, from the Virgin. For <hi>Nazianzen</hi> saith, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, whatsoever of our nature Christ assumed not from our nature, that he hath not heald, he meanes not saved, not redeemed. But this man will make <hi>Nazian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen,</hi> meane more in English, then he saith in Greeke. He saith, what Christ assumed not; not what hee assumed not from our nature; hee addes that. Christ assumed a soule; but not by propagation from his mother, but by creation from his Father. <hi>Nec absurdum est, ut qui pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo homini animam creavit, crearet et sibi. Aug. Ep.</hi> 99. S. <hi>Austin</hi> feared not that woe, sayd, <hi>Libentius responderim,</hi> he would rather answer, Christs soule came, <hi>Non de Adam, quam de Adam,</hi> not from <hi>Adam,</hi> then from him: that is, not from his Mother, but from God. And lest you may reply, that Christ might by prerogative have his soule from heaven, though wee have not: he saith of <hi>Levi</hi> too, <hi>nec Levi, nec Christus,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Christ,</hi> nor <hi>Levi</hi> were in <hi>Abrahams</hi> loynes, <hi>secundum Animam,</hi> in respect of the soule. If not <hi>Levi,</hi> then no man. <hi>Levi</hi> had no prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative.</p>
            <p>Another reason waightier then this indeede (the former waighed but in words) is the propgation of originall sinne. Which how can it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend from <hi>Adam</hi> to his sonnes, unlesse as all mens bodyes come from his, all mens soules doe so too? Since that originall sinne is as well in soule, as body, yea in soule most. For if God doe give the soule, as my Text saith, if he create it new, and put it in the body, and yet it be tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with sinne, when it is borne: eyther God made it so, and is then au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of sinne, which is blasphemie; or it selfe sinned in the wombe; (which to say, is absurd, for it could not, it had no use of reason) or the body, being it selfe conceived in sinne, infects the soule; which is more absurd. For a spirituall substance cannot take taint from a corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall. This led those learned Fathers into this errour, that the soule comes from the seede. They conceived not the conveiance of origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall sinne, but so. The scruple a long time stumbled Saint <hi>Austin</hi> to: hee knew not how else to answer the <hi>Pelagians.</hi> Now what say wee to this argument, this knot? How doth God give the spirit, create the
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:173124:288"/> soule; and yet it bee borne with originall sinne?</p>
            <p>There are two things considerable in originall sinne, <hi>Adams</hi> disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience imputed unto us, then in his loines, and the corruption of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, inclinable to evill, the paine of <hi>Adams</hi> disobedience. When we say the soule by conjunction with the body is defiled with sinne; wee meane not that the body workes upon the soule, and so infects it, as Pitch will defile with the very touch. But that at the same instant, at which God gives the spirit, puts it in the body, <hi>Adams</hi> disobedience is then imputed to the whole person; and so by consequent, corruption of nature, and inclination unto evill, the paine of <hi>Adams</hi> sinne, by Gods just appointment followes. For that sentence of Gods, <hi>morte mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieris, thou shalt surely dye,</hi> was given on us in <hi>Adam,</hi> as well as upon him. For the sinne of <hi>Adam</hi> was not meerely personall: he sinned not as one private man, one <hi>Individuum,</hi> but as the corpse of all mankind. There were <hi>in uno universi:</hi> his sinne was the guilt, <hi>non tam personae quam naturae,</hi> not his sinne onely, but all his posterities, the sinne of all his seede for ever after him, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, <hi>Naz.</hi> my forefathers fall was mine.</p>
            <p>But one reason more, theres no Scripture against propagation of soules. There is beside my Text, divers in the <hi>Psalms,</hi> &amp; in the Prophets. I have no time to cite them. To end the point, Heathens may checke Christians, Poets and Philosophers subscribe to <hi>Salomon,</hi> not some but all. To the Latin Fathers I oppose the Greeke; they all assent to <hi>Salomon</hi> too. Yea and Latin Fathers many, Saint <hi>Hierome, Ambrose, Lactantius, Prosper,</hi> and <hi>Arnobius,</hi> of the antient; but of the latter, all. Moderne Divines most. I pray your pardon, I have tired you with a craggy question, <hi>Questio obligatissima,</hi> Saint <hi>Austins</hi> terme, a perplex argument I determine it, God gives the soule, mans soule, he is the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of spirits, Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> terme: gives all things Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith too, but mans soule <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, makes it, creates it. That he did all things once; but mens spirits still, <hi>quotidie fabricat,</hi> that he daily creates them, is (saith S. <hi>Hierom) dogma ecclesiasticum.</hi>

            <p>To conclude, what if now after all this sayd on the Preachers side, the Preachers selfe be his owne adversary. He seemes, <hi>cap.</hi> 3. at 21. <hi>ver.</hi> and the 19. to supplant himselfe, both touching the Spirits Maker, and the returne of it to God. In the one, he confesseth, he knowes not, he, nor any, whether the spirit of man ascend or descend. There he doubts. But in the other he saith flatly, categorically, peremptorily, that there is <hi>Idem spiritus,</hi> the same spirit of beast and man, the one no better then the other. But for the first, <hi>Quis scit.</hi> Who knowes? saith he; thats an <hi>Hyperbole,</hi> no man knowes, <hi>i.</hi> very few. Sense and Reason hardly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scerne the things concerne the soule. They crave deepe understanding. And for the second, he meanes mans vitall soule; his vegetative soule; whose powers are but sense, motion, and generation, the brute crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath that, tis the same in man and beast. But the rationall spirit is proper to man onely: and <hi>Salomon</hi> meanes that here. <hi>That</hi> God gave, and that returnes to God, <hi>Cui cum filio, &amp;c.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat <hi>Flesh is Grasse,</hi> that <hi>All flesh is as Grasse,</hi> is no great point of Divinitie. An Humanist, an Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then may discourse this Argument. Would you like a Preacher should take it to his Text: Why not? Tis Scripture. And lest you thinke the Scripture may have haply some sayings, not so fit for Texts: God commends this to the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, commends it for a Text, <hi>Esay</hi> 40 6. A voice bids, <hi>Crie.</hi> The Prophet askes, <hi>What?</hi> The voyce answers, and tis Gods; that, <hi>All flesh is Grasse.</hi> The Corpse before us saith as much; but saith it softly, we heare not <hi>it.</hi> God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bids the Preacher crie it. The Corpse cries it to the Eye; thats but one sense. God cries it also to the Eare; to force us to attend, hee addes Oracle to Spectacle, that we may both heare and see at once the frailty, the vanitie, the mortalitie of man.</p>
            <p>The Proposition is Comparative; the things compar'd are <hi>Flesh</hi> and
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:173124:289"/>
               <hi>Grasse.</hi> The Note that should unite them, is exprest in the next clause, but supprest in this, the note of Comparison. <hi>Paul</hi> hath subjected all creatures unto vanitie, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 20. So did the <hi>Preacher</hi> before him, <hi>All things, sub sole, under the Sunne.</hi> Yea Sunne, and all, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things superiour than the Sunne, as the Firmament and Starres, <hi>Transi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunt,</hi> saith our Saviour; heaven is not excepted; all have their morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie. But the voyce commands me not to crie so much. <hi>Quae supra nos, nihil ad nos.</hi> It bids but crie, <hi>All Flesh.</hi> That terme may be mistaken too: it may meane more, than here it doth. Wee must confine it to the voyces sense. There is a Flesh of Beasts, and there is a Flesh of Foules; and Fishes also have their Flesh: <hi>Paul</hi>

               </gap>aith it, though it needes no Text, a thing of sense. The voyce here meanes not these. Tis true of these, of all these; they are subject too to vanitie. But this voyce in this place meanes onely man. It saith, <hi>All</hi> Flesh; the note is universall: but universalls have their bounds. That man is here meant onely, appeares by the next verse; <hi>it</hi> expoundeth this; here <hi>All flesh,</hi> there <hi>All people.</hi> And Saint <hi>Peter</hi> glosses it so too, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 24. The Subject then of this mortalitie is Man: Man onely, but man wholie; none excepted, all. <hi>All Flesh,</hi> that is, all men; <hi>is Grasse,</hi> that is, <hi>as Grasse:</hi> three words, no moe in the Originall, <hi>Omnis caro foenum;</hi> all three considerable severally.</p>
            <p>The subject must be first; for the Note is but a waiter. And the Trope would not be balkt, but that it is so frequent: and yet it is more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> remarkeable here; wee shall note it afterward. Man is meant here by Flesh. Man Gods immediat workemanship: the Plants, the Fish, the Beasts, the Earth and Waters brought forth <hi>them.</hi> Yea all the other creatures, God but said, <hi>Let</hi> them be. But man God made himselfe; <hi>Thy hands</hi> (saith <hi>David) fashioned me.</hi> Gods Workes <hi>all</hi> good: but man the grace and glory of them all; the perfection of the Creation. Is so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent a creature, destinate to death? Hee for whom they all were made, the <hi>end</hi> of all the creatures, must he end like other creatures? He whom God held worthy, to put all things under <hi>his</hi> feet, doth he match him with the Grasse, under the Beasts feet? Man, whom <hi>David</hi> makes <hi>little lower than the Angels,</hi> Christ equall to the Angels; the Grasse lower than the Beasts, is it equall unto him? Of whom Gods Sonne saith, <hi>Sunt sicut Angeli,</hi> men are as the Angels; of him doth Gods selfe say, <hi>Caro sicut foe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, thats <hi>Philoes</hi> too, a plant from heaven, to a plant on earth? Tis much, that what God said of him, said in scorne, <hi>Behold man is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come like one of us;</hi> the Beasts should say of him, say in earnest, Behold, man is become like one of us; <hi>Comparatus est jumentis, Psal</hi> 49. hee is compared unto the beasts that perish. But the disparagement is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that the plants much baser creatures should say of him, Behold, man is become like one of us; <hi>Scut foenum, dies hominis,</hi> mans dayes are like the Grasse, man made by God, who lives for ever; wrought of earth, which stands for ever; quickned by a soule, which never dies, and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated for Gods glory, which never never ends; Can of causes so firme, so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing as these, come an effect so weake, so withering as Grasse?</p>
            <p>Now note, I pray you, the terme here in my Text. Tis not for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, that God speakes in Trope. He could have said, all <hi>men,</hi> as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily as all <hi>fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>sh.</hi> But bidding the Prophet to proclaime mans mortalitie, he would stile him by a terme, which should imply the reason. A man consists of soule, as well as <hi>Flesh;</hi> and the soule sometimes is put for man. <hi>Da mihi animas,</hi> said the King of <hi>Sodome</hi> unto <hi>Abraham, give mee the soules, i.</hi> the men. Not mans phrase onely, but Gods too, <hi>Anima quae peccat, the soule that sinnes shall die,</hi> that is, the man. But here hee calls man <hi>flesh,</hi> purposedly; his frailtie comes from it: the soule is immortall; tis the Flesh makes man obnoxious to mortalitie. You will say, sinne makes him; so it doth; but in the flesh: Spirits die not. Mans soule, which God breathed in them, was it not <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> a spirit of life? True as well <hi>subjectivè,</hi> as <hi>effectivè.</hi> But the body disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taged by his materialls, the flesh being made of mould, might suffer death: and so did, and so it doth. Man made of it must needs be mortall.</p>
            <p>For <hi>what is man? Iobs</hi> question. <hi>Is he a sea, a Whale? His strength</hi> is it <hi>stone,</hi> or his substance is it <hi>stelle?</hi> Our hearts indeede are hautie, and our spirits strong, like the <hi>Amorite</hi> in the Prophet, <hi>High as the Cedar, sturdie as the Oake;</hi> every one as the sonne of a King. But as the <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monian</hi> said of the Nightingale, hearing her so shrill, and seeing her so small, <hi>Vox est praetereà nihil,</hi> she was nothing but a voice: so may I say of man, <hi>Cor est, pratereà nihil,</hi> he is nothing but a heart.

            </p>
            <p>To end this, Humanitie, and Mortalitie are individually linkt. Can a man not re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ember the name of his Father? Or say, haply he doe, can he forget his owne? My Fathers name was <hi>Adam, &amp; homo sum,</hi> as <hi>Mitio</hi> said, I my selfe amman. Both words are from the earth. From it we are come, to it we shall goe. I may forget my <hi>name</hi> as soone as my mortalitie. The Note hath waited long; come wee to it. <hi>All</hi> Flesh is Grasse, that is, <hi>every</hi> man is mortall. Tis an idle Theme, you will thinke, and needelesse to presse the generalitie of death. But the voyce hath put <hi>it</hi> too in the crie; and I may not smoother it.</p>
            <pb n="542" facs="tcp:173124:290"/>
            <p>Man but <hi>thinkes</hi> he is a King, but plaies <hi>Rex</hi> only, he <hi>is</hi> none, none light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. But death is one indeede. Not a King only, but an Emperour, a right <hi>Pambasilcus,</hi> Catholike King more truely, than ever was King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> an universall King. All <hi>Cesars</hi> his subjects, an Oecumenicall King, <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rorum Rex, Iob</hi> hath it; he might have said, <hi>Terrarum Rex;</hi> death is a Prince paramont, the supreme Monarch over all mankind on earth. Sexe, Age, Condition, are dispenst with, in some cases. Death favours none. For Sexe; I have heard some say, that women have no soules; but <hi>none,</hi> they have no bodies. Flesh they are, <hi>Eve</hi> was. <hi>Adam</hi> said it, of whose flesh shee was, <hi>Caro de carne mea,</hi> the womans flesh of mans, and so grasse, as well as he. [Nay; and of the two, the woman was grasse first, mortall before the man; for she fell first,] If sexe have any priviledge; tis the mans. There are two exempts of men, <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> that died not, not one of women; no not of Christs owne mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Some say, she sinned not; none, she died not: And they say, she was taken up in heaven bodily; but they grant, she died first, if they did not; we would prove it.</p>
            <p>For age, the budde is blasted as soone as the blown rose; and the Lambe comes to the shambles, as well as the growne sheepe. <hi>Seneca</hi> saith elegantly, <hi>Non citamur ex censu,</hi> death lookes not in Church Book, or Checker Rolles, to see mens yeares, and so to summon them. The Cradle protects not; Infants die in it. Nay the wombe protects not; many die in it. My sonne, or my daughter, <hi>Post me mori debet, ante me potest,</hi> they <hi>must</hi> die after me, they <hi>may</hi> before me. The child but a spanne long is borne to buriall; and the Iewes say in their Proverbe, In <hi>Golgotha</hi> are sculles of all cises.</p>
            <p>For condition, death puts no difference betweene mens states, <hi>respects no persons, takes no gifts.</hi> Indeede the Grave, like the Horseleeches daughters, cries <hi>Da, Give, give:</hi> But whats the gift? My Text names it, it is <hi>Flesh.</hi> The Greekes hence call the Grave, <hi>Sarcophagon,</hi> a flesh ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Not the flesh of Fowles or Beasts: it is a <hi>Canniball,</hi> it eates mans flesh. And mans flesh without difference; death is no distinguisher. The <hi>Bagger died,</hi> Christ saith in the Parable, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, but <hi>the rich man died</hi> too. The rich, the mightie, the honourable man, none comes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse to death. <hi>Magnus &amp; parvus illic,</hi> saith <hi>Iob,</hi> the grave receives them all. <hi>Sarcophagus</hi> is <hi>Pamphagus,</hi> it eates, devoures <hi>all</hi> flesh. Even Kings and Counsellers, <hi>Iob</hi> saith, it takes them too. Princes are Gods, God saith it, <hi>Dixi, Dii est is;</hi> they are gods on earth; but they are gods of earth, as the Cynicke said to <hi>Alexander.</hi> The mightiest, though he be greater <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap> in his substance; flesh as well as they, and so grasse as well as they. Foole or wiseman, learned or ignorant, bond or free, none free from death.</p>
            <p>To end this second point, saith the Apostle, <hi>Mors intravit,</hi> death but entred only into the world? It did more and <hi>Paul</hi> saith it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 12. not <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> too, it hath gone thorow it; not (<hi>Invasit</hi>) onely, set upon the borders and outward skirts of it, but (<hi>pervasit</hi>) too, hath peirst into the inland, into the heart of it. Heathens are rich in this; but we neede them not. Death like a Deluge hath overflowed all flesh.
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:173124:290"/> It passes <hi>Noahs</hi> floud: Eight persons scaped it, death not one. Like sinne, it seased on <hi>all.</hi> Nay, it hath past sinne too. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>All men have sinned;</hi> but one hath not. One scap't; <hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>No not one.</hi> But one hath, and one neere to <hi>David,</hi> even his sonne. One hath scap't sinne, Christ hath; but death not one; not Gods one, <hi>Dei unicus,</hi> Gods <hi>belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved one.</hi> God hath exempted him <hi>from sinne,</hi> but not excepted him from death. Onely Christ died, <hi>Quia voluit,</hi> because it pleased him so: Every one else, <hi>Quia debuit,</hi> because he ought (doe so.) Death is a debt, owne by us all. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, saith the Poet, wee all are owne to death. For we all are dust, and <hi>dust</hi> (saith the <hi>Preacher) must returne to that it was.</hi> And there is no way to <hi>it,</hi> but death; called therefore by <hi>Iosua, via omnis terrae, the way of all earth.</hi> It was our wombe; it must be our Tombe; It bore us, and must burie us. It must us all, all flesh. Be it flesh of Iew or Grecian, Infidell, or Christian, Priest or people, holy or prophane, <hi>Caesar</hi> or <hi>Lazar,</hi> be it whose flesh soever, <hi>finis est cinis,</hi> ashes is our end. Enough of the Note; a right Criers note; they lightly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne so.</p>
            <p>The Predicate remaines, the thing to which, <hi>Flesh</hi> is compared, tis <hi>Grasse.</hi> Mans life is likened to many things in Scripture; to none more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> fitly, than to Grasse; and therefore to it often. Other things haply fit it but in one point, some one point onely, this in many. For the false de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of it, tis likened to a <hi>Dreame;</hi> for the shortnesse, to a <hi>Tabernacle;</hi> for the swiftnesse, to a <hi>Cloud,</hi> to a <hi>Weavers shuttle,</hi> to a <hi>Post,</hi> to <hi>a Ship, an Eagle.</hi> But mans whole state is figured in the <hi>Grasse, Quis, Qualis, Vnde, Quo,</hi> his Breed, his Growth, his Chances, and his End; Grasse represents them all. From out the earth springs it; out of the same came he. Man is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> from the earth, faith <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Moses</hi>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> from the ground; alls one. Rise he nere so high; <hi>Iob</hi> saith, <hi>His foundation is in the dust.</hi> For Growth, the holy Ghost in Scripture, as it likens man to Grasse; so flourishing man to the greene Grasse. And Saint <hi>Peter</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares as bare Flesh, to bare Grasse: so <hi>the glory of man to the flower of grasse.</hi> For Chance and End, the Grasse, haply the beast croppeth it, or the Worme wasteth it, the Drouth starveth it; the Haile smiteth it; or the Winde blasteth it. Or, if it last out his full time; yet the Sithe at last cutteth it downe. So is mans life at every creatures mercy. Fire, Water, Sicknesse, Theefe, Poyson, Famin, Sword. And though hee scape all casualties to the utmost of mans age; yet then comes a mower. Why should Death be pictured with a Sithe, if man were not as Grasse? Man live he long is <hi>as Grasse, gramen prati, Medow grasse;</hi> or die hee soone, yet <hi>gramen tecti,</hi> the <hi>Grasse</hi> on the <hi>house top,</hi> which <hi>antè arescit, quàm maturescit, withereth,</hi> saith the Prophet, <hi>Even before it be growne up.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Point, the Scripture mēanes mainely here, is the frailtie of man onely; the comparison of Grasse is used but to show <hi>that:</hi> that <hi>as the Grasse,</hi> so man, <hi>in the morning groweth and flourisheth,</hi> saith the <hi>Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist, in the evening is cut downe, and withereth.</hi> Mans life <hi>is like a leafe; Iob</hi> saith, a <hi>faded leafe,</hi> and his substance, <hi>as the drie stubble;</hi>

            <p>To conclude, God graces man, to call him <hi>Grasse;</hi> farre weaker, farre more momentanie things would have served to have compared him to. He that likened him to a vapour, tis Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> thought him more fraile than Grasse. But the Proverbe passes him; <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

But Saint <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> but three, <hi>Death, Iudgement</hi> and <hi>Hell.</hi> Our Funerall Theme is thē first mostly. Tis fittest then to preach of death. But the Epicure will take advantage at that argument; cry <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Let
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:173124:292"/> us eate and drinke, for to morrow wee shall dye. Paul</hi> therefore puts to, a <hi>post hoc; statutum est, It is appointed, that men doe dye once.</hi> But thats not all; read on, <hi>and after that Iudgement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The sensuall man, though loath, yet because hee needs must, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to dye. But <hi>Iudgement</hi> is but a swore subject, pleaseth no sinner. Death was <hi>Timendum,</hi> we feare it; Iudgement is <hi>Tremendum,</hi> Saint <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gories</hi> terme, wee quake at it. <hi>Felix</hi> himselfe a Iudge, <hi>trembled</hi> when <hi>Paul</hi> preacht of <hi>Iudgement.</hi> Yea and by <hi>Salomons</hi> leave, death is not all mens end, will <hi>Lucian</hi> say, by Gods leave haply too, hee saith <hi>Gen. 6. universae carnis,</hi> the end of all flesh. <hi>Enoch</hi> was but translated, did not dye. <hi>Elias</hi> went up in body into heaven, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, saith Saint <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sil,</hi> with his flesh. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith plainly, <hi>Wee shall not dye all, 1 Cor.</hi> 15. 51. But appeare before Gods judgement seat wee shall <hi>all, Rom.</hi> 14. some scape mans judgement, none shall Gods.</p>
            <p>Yet some strong heart hath some hope for all this. Say the sinne bee sentenced, judgement past. How many condemned persons, doomd to dye, have obtained pardon, and have lived? The repreev'd priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner oft escapes. But my Text hath instant execution? Christ repreeves none, hath no sooner sentenced, convicted sinners; but legions of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioners, the devills runne on them, hale them (<hi>obtorto collo</hi>) imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly to hell. This is no plausible theme. Their feet are <hi>beautifull (Paul</hi> saith) <hi>that preach peace,</hi> you will haply wish my tongue were si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced, that come to preach judgement and execution. But is the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers office, to please, or to edifie? enough in generality.</p>
            <p>Take we now the termes apart, the subject first, <hi>These.</hi> Who These? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Tis but a relative, referres us to some terme before. See the 41. verse, <hi>Those</hi> on the <hi>left hand</hi> of the Iudge. Thats but a relative too to the 33. there they are cald <hi>Goates.</hi> That terme is obscure yet. All expositours understand by it, the wicked and ungodly. [Goe no further for proofe, then to the words following, <hi>But the righteous into life eternall.</hi>] <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, by Goates (saith <hi>Oecumenius</hi>) are meant sinners. Saint <hi>Austin</hi> saith it too. <hi>These</hi> shall goe into paines; the Sonne of <hi>David</hi> saith it here. His Father sayd it before, <hi>Psal. 9. 17. be turned into hell.</hi> Thats (as Saint <hi>Luke</hi> saith of <hi>Iudas, Act.</hi> 1. 25.) <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, <hi>their proper</hi> and due <hi>place.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It should seemē by the 42. and 43. verses, that all sinners are not meant, but onely the mercilesse, that feed not, that cloath not, that harbour not the poore. It pleased our Saviour to give instance but in them. But all sorts of sinners shall receive the same sentence, all impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent sinners. The <hi>Righteous</hi> in the next clause, that are adjudged to <hi>life,</hi> were sinners too sometimes. But God had given them grace to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent. The gracelesse are meant here that repēnt not; they onely, but they all. Not onely the non-releevers of the poorē, but also the non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>observers of the Law, in whatsoever kind. The leacher, the idolater, the extortioner, the theefe, the drunkard, the blasphemer; Saint <hi>Paul</hi> hath a longe Catalogue; the lot of them all is in the Lake of fire.</p>
            <p>The argument is strong, <hi>à Minore,</hi> in this forme. If the omitters of good offices shall not escape paine; then the committers of evill shall
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:173124:292"/> be punished much more. <hi>Cain</hi> that slew his brother, <hi>Cham</hi> that disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured his Father, <hi>Esau</hi> that sold his birth-right, <hi>Iudas</hi> that betrayed Christ, <hi>Iulian</hi> that renounced him, these haply shall lead, have the <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap> the deepest roome in Hell. But there shall also follow punee sinners too. As in God the Fathers kingdome, so in the devils too, are many mansions, roome enough for all reprobates, for them all, but for them onely. Life, life everlasting is prepared for the righteous; but eternall paine for these. These have denyed God, defied Religion, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted Christ, robd Widdowes and Orphans, corrupted others, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed themselves; have served Sathan here, shall burne with Sathan there. <hi>Salomon</hi> askes, <hi>Cui vae? to whom is woe?</hi> The Prophet answers, <hi>vae genti peccatrici, Esa. 1. 4.

But from whom must these goe? Thats supprest here, but exprest in the 41. <hi>verse, discedite à Me,</hi> they must <hi>goe from Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The execution hath two <hi>vehs;</hi> this is the first, and worst, farre worse then the second, then the <hi>Terminus ad quem.</hi> Thats fearefull, to paine, eternall paine. This passeth it, to goe from Christ. The righteous goe too; but <hi>with</hi> him into heaven. These are commanded away, must goe <hi>from</hi> him into hell. Into hell? thats not so much. It were happinesse to goe to hell <hi>with him.</hi> No joy to the righteous to goe without him into Heaven. Heaven is hell <hi>without</hi> Christ; hell <hi>with</hi> him is Heaven. The blessednesse of the Saints lies not so much in the place, as in the company; not onely the society of Angels, but the presence of Gods selfe, the fruition of Christ, the beholding the incomparable beauty of Gods countenance. The privation whereof is the extremity of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery, exceeds the paines, the matchlesse, the endlesse paines of hell; passes <hi>Mille gehennas;</hi> 1000. hells, saith Saint <hi>Chrysostome.</hi> The <hi>Poena damni</hi> is worse then <hi>Poena sensus;</hi> more ease in sense of Torment, then in losse of Christ. <hi>In coelum jusseris ibit?</hi> Bid me goe to hell; I will to be with Christ. As the scribe saith in the Gospel, <hi>sequar te, quocun{que} ieris,</hi> I will follow Christ, whethersoever he goeth. Vnder his wings, the shaddow of his wings, no flames can scorch me, no worme gnaw me, no feend touch me.</p>
            <p>The Queene of <hi>Sheba</hi> held it happinesse to stand before <hi>Salomon,</hi> to heare his wisedome. What to stand before God, to see his glory? <hi>A bigail</hi> thought it honour to be but <hi>Davids handmaid,</hi> but <hi>to wash his servants feete.</hi> What to waite on God, and to behold his face? Christs
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:173124:293"/> selfe calls them blessed, that shall <hi>see</hi> God, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 8. Thats <hi>indeede</hi> (as the schoole termes it) <hi>visio beatifica,</hi> a sight that makes true blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. There bee many <hi>Beatitudes,</hi> Divines reckon eight. The most blessed of them all is to see God. The society of the Saints, Martyrs, Apostles, Patriarks, <hi>Gloriosum hoc, this</hi> is great glory, saith Saint <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine.</hi> But to be present with God, to behold him, thats <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, a waight of glory, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (as <hi>Paul</hi> speakes) an <hi>excellent, a most</hi> excellent, a <hi>farre most excellent eternall waight of glory.</hi> To see God, not <hi>in specie,</hi> (the Patriarkes saw him so, saw him in resemblance) but <hi>infacie,</hi> face to face; we shall see him so, <hi>Paul</hi> saith. Not as it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him to appeare to mans weak sense; but as he is <hi>indeede.</hi> Not as now <hi>in speculo,</hi> in a glasse, but <hi>in seipso,</hi> in himselfe. The Fathers power, the Sonnes wisedome, the Spirits goodnesse, the incomparable beauty, the unutterable majestie, the unconceiveable glory of the whole Trinity. From this shall <hi>these,</hi> these in my Text be driven and <hi>depart.</hi> For to see God, is <hi>sanctorum praemium, Augustine,</hi> a Reward, a Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive proper to the Saints.</p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> is not content to say, they shall be punisht, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 8, 9. <hi>punisht with flaming fire and eternall perdition,</hi> the <hi>terminus ad quem,</hi> but addes the <hi>Aquo</hi> too, <hi>from the presence of the Lord, and from the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his power.</hi> To be shut out of the <hi>Quire,</hi> but of the Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, so they might be with Christ, they should be happy.

                  </gap>.</note> meanes he? It should seeme to be light, by the long lasting; <hi>Dolor si longus, levis.</hi> That rule holds not in hell. Among <hi>Origens</hi> errours <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> notes this for one, that the paines of the devill and the damned are but the conscience of sinne. But what is it? Looke againe at the 41. <hi>verse,</hi> tis <hi>Fire.</hi> Paine hath <hi>magis &amp; minus,</hi> some much sharper then other. Fire is worst. Tooth-ach, stone, cholicke, womens paines, are <hi>all</hi> grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, <hi>all</hi> extreame. And yet for the first three, the heart of a man will not lightly shrinke; and the fourth, though it force the woman to cry out in the weakenesse of her sex; yet shee beares it with some patience. But the strongest courage of the stoutest man, will faile at the feeling of a little fire. If foote, or finger, any part bee but held in it nere so small a while: the exquisite anguish will wrest strong cries from him, and force him to fare like a man beside himselfe.</p>
            <p>In all those paines and other, there are some <hi>Intervalla;</hi> the patient hath some rest. Like agues, they have fits come and goe, give often breathing and release. There is some pitty with the paine. But Fire (we say in proverbe) hath no mercy. This mercilesse torment must the sinner goe unto, from the presence of the Iudge. A sad sentence, but the judgement just. Hee had no pitty on poore soules in earth; It will have no pitty on his soule in hell. Nay the wise man bidding him, <hi>Miserere animae tuae,</hi> O pitty thine owne soule, would not doe that <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sereri
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:173124:293"/> sui,</hi> pitty himselfe here, he shall cry to the Tormentors, <hi>Miserere mei;</hi> they will not there.</p>
            <p>Some so lighten the paine, say, tis but Fire in metaphor. That I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not stand to argue. But they shall finde it no figure, that shall feele it. Nay is it but Fire? is it not a worse thing? Christ calls it Fire; wee must rest in his terme. But not ordinary Fire. I thinke, the hottest, fiercest fire on earth, compared unto it, is but as a flame painted on a wall. [Our Fire hath light, that hath not. <hi>Clemens</hi> calls it <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, <hi>Perdition everlasting. Bernard, perpetuum<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vae,</hi> everlasting woe.</p>
            <p>First, how so? The schoole disputes it, I will not. Christ hath sayd it; thats enough. What hee sayes, I beleeve. Fire indeede ends with the object, devours it, and goes out. But Fiers object in hell shall have no end. Soules and bodyes shall burne, but not waste. Did not the bush so on mount <hi>Sinai?</hi> burnt, but consumed not? The fewell of hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire, sinners soules and bodies, by Gods supernaturall provision shall not consume. How can the flames then still fed, go out?</p>
            <p>Secondly, why so? Is that Gods mercy; will leud <hi>Lucian</hi> say, to award perpetuall paine to temporarie sinne? Nay, is that Gods justice, that the censure shall exceede the sinne? <hi>Summum jus,</hi> (we say) is <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juria,</hi> the rigour of the Law is wrong, to punish the delinquent to the utmost extremity. This is more, the paine to passe the crime. Peace Atheist; God for all this is not unjust. Tax not his mercy neither. Time of mercy is past; God proffered that in this world, and twas despised. Christ is now come to judge. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (Saint <hi>Iames</hi> saith) is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is mercilesse, the last judgement. Gods judgements here are mixt with mercy: looke for none there, but meere justice. And yet there is; Christ even there too is mercifull; the sinners Paine is short of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert. Wickednesse is worthy worse punishment, then the damned shall suffer even in hell.</p>
            <p>Say it be not; say Gods mercy end there; yet chaleng not his justice.
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:173124:294"/> Tis no wrong to the sinner, that his paine is everlasting, a never dying worme, and fire unquenchable. For it is for never-dying sinne, and lust unquenchable. Mans sinne had his <hi>Aeternum,</hi> as well as Gods Fire. Had the sinner lived world without end, his sinne too would have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted world without end. Nay though he dyed, sinne dyed not with him: he sinnes still even in hell; hates God, blasphemes him, curses, despaires. Malice, envy, all sinnes perpetrable there, worse and greater in hell, then they were here. God is not unjust, if he punish eternally, those that tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe eternally. Poets show, Heathens held this, hell paines eternall.—<hi>Sedet aeternum que sedebit Infelix Thescus.</hi> Nay, say sin ended in earth, or were not eternall; yet may paine be endlesse, and God just. For sinne trespasses God, who is infinite; and therefore m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rits a paine infinite.</p>
            <p>To end this, tis strange, what Heathens beleeved, Christians should question. <hi>Origen</hi> one of the Fathers did, held hell paines are not eternall; <hi>all</hi> there, not men onely, devils too shall at length be enlarged. If he did, I say with <hi>Photius,</hi> he was <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, but he was also <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, he wrote much, but he erred much. Haply he is wronged; some hereticks might corrupt his writings. For I finde him say expressely, not once, nor twice, that hell torments have no end. Indeed the <hi>Priscillianists</hi> sayd, they have; grant them <hi>Aeterna,</hi> because Scriptures say so; but yet prove, they end. Will you heare how wisely? Because eternitie is not perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity, as the Greeke <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, meanes, unlesse unto <hi>Aeternum</hi> there be also added, <hi>&amp; in seculum seculi.</hi> This I reade in S. <hi>Austin.</hi> They are not worth the answering: instance against them is infinite. Indeede <hi>Aeternitas</hi> is sometime but <hi>diuturnitas,</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> meanes not alwayes everlasting. But that it doth here, appeares by the parallel. Hell fire is cald unquencha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Will they say, <hi>Inextinguibilis</hi> needs to have added too, <hi>In seculum seculi,</hi> or else it will goe out? Christ saith flatly, Hell Fire never go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out.</p>
            <p>To conclude, as the promise of the Gospell is eternall life, so the Law threatens everlasting death. If it be false, <hi>Quod minatus est,</hi> that God threatens, then tis false too, <hi>Quod policitus est,</hi> that he promises, saith Saint <hi>Gregory.</hi> If <hi>Supplicia reproborum</hi> shall have end, then <hi>Gaudia Beatorum</hi> shall end also. But what if examples confute us? Tis sayd, Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> rid <hi>Trajan</hi> out of hell; <hi>Tecla, Falconilla, Perpetua,</hi> her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Saint <hi>Dunstan,</hi> King <hi>Edwin, Fr. Xavier</hi> too a Pagans daughter. Foure examples, one as true as another; shamelesse lyes all. Yeeld them true. Though God release some in this world: after judgement he will not. Then will be <hi>ex inferno nulla redemptio.</hi> I wonder none of the Patriarkes, none of the holy Prophets ever did the like, men as gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious with God, as <hi>Xavier,</hi> S. <hi>Dunstan,</hi> or Pope <hi>Gregory.</hi> Only I forget, the Pope may pleade prerogative, to let when he lists, any soule out of hell. Hath he not the keyes of it? But there will be no Pope after the day of judgement. I end; <hi>These, i.</hi> sinners <hi>shall goe, abibunt, goe</hi> from Christ, whose presence is true happinesse; goe <hi>into Fire,</hi> torment which cannot, and yet must be indured; into <hi>Fire everlasting;</hi> and <hi>who can dwell</hi> (saith <hi>Esay) in everlasting burning?</hi> from that paine everlasting, the Lord deliver us, <hi>Cui, &amp;c.</hi>

Paul</hi> saith, <hi>It is appointed unto men to die once; Et post hoc, Iudicium, And after that, Iudgement.</hi> The Translation to make sense, in the <hi>Geneva</hi> Bibles, inserts a word, in smaller Characters, <hi>After</hi> (commeth) <hi>Iudgement.</hi> That small insertion helpes you to undersTand, Me to divide my Text; The thing that <hi>Comes,</hi> and the <hi>Time</hi> of the <hi>that</hi> comming.

            <p>Mans judgement goes before, and death followes, if the crime be capitall. Sentence goes ever before Execution.

            </p>
            <p>Heathens knew not this; they stretch mans life, but <hi>Sepulchro tenus,</hi> to the Grave onely, saith <hi>Theodoret:</hi> Especially the most of them, Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures and Atheists. Death (they say) is, <hi>Vltima linea rerum,</hi> the last line of all things. It is not. It is of things, of living things, All, saving
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:173124:295"/> men. The beast dies, theres his end. Fish, Foule, every brute creature end with death. Man doth not, ends not, when he dies. Theres a <hi>Plus ultra,</hi> something beyond death.</p>
            <p>Surely besides Heathens, others have made death mans end, utmost end. <hi>Sadducees</hi> did, a sect of Iewes. <hi>Seneca</hi> did, whom I hold not an Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, a meere Heathen; but halfe a Christian. Hee said, <hi>Post mortem nihil est,</hi> theres nothing after death. <hi>Simon</hi> and <hi>Cerdo</hi> did, <hi>Manes</hi> and <hi>Marcion;</hi> All these, Heretickes, not Heathens. One Bishop did, <hi>Syne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ptolemais,</hi> held all points of Christian Religion, saving that, stucke at the <hi>Resurrection.</hi> Yet not just as Heathens did, that death determined All; but mens bodies onely, not their soules, granted them immortall. Said I but one Bishop? <hi>Ecce autem alterum,</hi> a Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> did too, did just as Heathens did; made death end all things, soules and all. Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> 23. did. Not hee alone; Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the third did too, if storie may be beleeved. Indeede Scripture (to seeming) saith as much, the <hi>Preacher</hi> doth, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 7. 4. calls death <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

The soules estate till Christs second comming; the day of judgement; and the joint-condition of soule and body both, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that day, are three lines more after our death; death is not the last, and therefore Divines reckon <hi>Quatuor novissima,</hi> foure latter ends; and the wise man bids, remember them, <hi>Memorare novissima, Eccles. 7. ult.</hi> It is in the English, but, remember the end.

It may our life; perhaps to day. But theres more behind, a thousand times more after, then before. My life, live I an hundred, nine hundred yeeres, as some have done, is nothing to the world to come; but as a day, an houre unto eternitie. Death is an end, but an end that hath an end.

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as the Comicke speaks, a death immortall. Poets, all Heathens reckon the first so. Hell, whether Heathens held all soules descended, is (saith the Tragicke) <hi>Invius retrò lacus,</hi> no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse thence; <hi>Acheron</hi> is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, no Egresse out of hell. That a dead man should <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, live againe, you must pardon Heathens that. They thinke the dead <hi>Nusquam esse, ne esse quidem,</hi> that we quite cease to be; that we shall be being dead, as we were before we lived, have no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence. This made the swinish Epicures crie, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Let us eate and drinke for to morrow we shall die.</hi> Thou brutish belly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>god, dost thou with to morrowes death, defend to dayes drunkennesse. Learne better Logicke of Divinitie. Religion on that Argument will conclude the quite contrary. To morrow thou maist die; therefore to day be sober. They made their <hi>Enthymeme</hi> upon the supposition of no other world, but this. Say, Saint <hi>Pauls</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, be not yee deceived, will not perswade; they scorne Scripture. Let them heare Heathens; <hi>Plato</hi> teaches that, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, they shall pay for it in hell. Theres a <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and a <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> both. Hell is for sinne as well as after it.</p>
            <p>To end this, death discharges all debts, cancells all bonds, frees all censures, ends all suites, quits all accusations. Thats but in matters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene man and man. But if man be Gods debtor, as we all are, unlesse Christ have payed for us; death is but Gods Arrest: his Declaration, his whole prosecution, and execution too, follow long after, all at the day of Iudgement. Onely a part of the paine the soule suffers in the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim;</hi> but all <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, after death.</p>
            <p>You see, <hi>Quod sit,</hi> that somewhat followes death; see <hi>Quid sit,</hi> What it is, <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Iudgement,</hi> thats deaths <hi>Post hoc,</hi> his after-comer. But whats that? Christs summons of the dead, dead and living both, All of both, to receive sentence (<hi>All</hi>) according to their workes. All this, Atheists denie, <hi>Sadducees</hi> too, Heathens too All, in this manner. Christians some, a great summe, as seemes by our lives. The <hi>Sadducees</hi> saying was <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> there is neither Iudgement nor Iudge. That men denie it, tis no marvell. For Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> calls it a Mysterie, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 10. 7. And S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith the Resurrection was not beleeved, was <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> incredible, <hi>Act.</hi> 26. Then this too; for it is the end of that. The dead rise there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be judged. Tis called even by Christs selfe, <hi>Resurrectio Iudicii, Iohn</hi> 5. 29.</p>
            <p>To satisfie the <hi>Sadducee,</hi> the Pagan, or the Atheist, I seeke not. <hi>Ride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur,</hi> saith <hi>Tert.</hi> they laugh at us, <hi>Dechachinnamur,</hi> laugh a loud at us, urging this Article. I leave Heathens to heathen Oracles; the Sybills long before Christ prophesied of Iudgement. I but pray to perswade you, to whom I preach. I therefore say to you, as <hi>Paul</hi> did to <hi>Agrippa,</hi> doe you beleeve Scripture? I know you doe. The Doctrine of Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is there both plaine and plentifull. Christ often mentions it in
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:173124:296"/> Saint <hi>Matthew:</hi> Some Prophets too; All the Apostles in their Epistles. Take but one for a taste. Appeare before Gods Iudgement seate, wee <hi>Shall, Rom.</hi> 14. theres the Certaintie. We <hi>must, 2 Cor.</hi> 5. theres the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie. And All is in both; we shall all, wee must all; theres the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralitie.</p>
            <p>First for the last, the Generalitie, Antichrists Iudgement seate sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons all; exempts not Kings, not Emperours. Himselfe must appeare here, before Christs Iudgement seat. <hi>All</hi> shall? What if some Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures have the flat contradiction, say, <hi>some</hi> shall not? Sinners shall not, <hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>Psal. 1. 5. Non resurgent in Iudicio.</hi> Then not some. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers shall not, <hi>Davids</hi> sonne saith, <hi>Ioh. 5. 24. Non venit in Iudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um.</hi> Then not any. Put them together, they spell flat Contrarietie; thats more than Contradiction. <hi>Davids</hi> phrase dazled <hi>Lactantius,</hi> a learned Father, but not skilled in the Hebrew, made him write, sinners shall not rise. For Latine Fathers read it so, <hi>Non Resurgent,</hi> a bad Translation. The Originall word hath more senses than one, signifies to stand, as well as to arise. <hi>Septuagints</hi> indeed turne it, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. They were Iewes; and many Iewes held an heresie, that sinners soules die with their bodies. <hi>R. Kimchi</hi> saith plainely, <hi>in locum.</hi> They might have left the Preposition out, have translated it, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>David</hi> meant it so. Sinners shall not <hi>stare</hi> in <hi>Iudicio.</hi> Thats all one, you will say. It is not. <hi>Stare in Iudicio,</hi> Thats all one, you will say. It is not. <hi>Stare in Iudicio,</hi> is to be quit in triall, to be found upright. Sinners shall not so; they shall <hi>Cadere in Iudicio,</hi> not Stand, but Fall. <hi>i.</hi> be found guiltie.</p>
            <p>For the other place, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 24. In all your English bookes, even the last Translation too, it is, The beleever shall not come into condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Which I marvell at. Thats to Expound, not to Translate. The Originall is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, thats Iudgement, not Damnation: and words are to be turned, not as they meane in Trope, but as they signifie. Christ in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede meant in Trope <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

            <p>
               <hi>Iob</hi> is objected too; he saith of good and bad, neither once asleepe, <hi>i.</hi> once dead, shall ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="555" facs="tcp:173124:296"/> or a Saint in heaven. All shall assemble before Christ. Some doubt whether Angels shall bee judged. Yet shall they waite on the Iudge at least, all of them; the Iudges selfe saith it, <hi>Matthew 25. 31. All the holy Angels.</hi>

            <p>And for the Certaintie, who will question a <hi>Creed</hi> Article? Christ, Prophets, Apostles have (as you heard) avoucht it. Nay, theres one saw it, though a thing to come, yet hath seene it already, seene it already, seene it <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

Yet as in things of nature, nothing is so sure, but some sceptick will question it, some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it quite; as who doubts, snow is white, yet one Philosopher sayd, twas blacke: so in things of faith, even points of greatest certainty have found opposers. Heathen denied, all, the resurrection, Christians some too; how say some among you, saith Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> sayd flatly, <hi>non est,</hi> there is none. You heard one <hi>Non est</hi> before; heres another. But all granted a judgement. None deny it, save Sadducees and Atheists. But Gentiles meant not <hi>Pauls</hi> judgement here, a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall judgement at the worlds end. Theirs was a particular of every soule presently after death. They held all soules descended into hell, and were instantly examined by three Iudges there, and doomed, as they deserved, some to torments, some the joyes. Theirs was <hi>post hoc</hi> too; but it was immediatly: Ours attends Christs comming. Thats in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede <hi>quickly,</hi> but not presently. Pardon Heathens that: you heard of some Christians that were more heathenish. To end this; for the two <hi>Non ests</hi> before, <hi>Damascen</hi> hath two <hi>Erits,</hi>

               </gap>, Certainely (saith he) there shall be a judgement.</p>
            <p>There shall be, is that all? The sonne of <hi>Belial</hi> will beare that. God saith, it shall be; tells not, when. Time to come hath great latitude. The world hath seene 5000. yeares already, may 5000. more, many five thousands more, if <hi>Platoes Magnus Annus</hi> hold, 48000. yeares, and continue not things still in the state God first created them? Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>shall</hi> be, you say: but before the worlds last day, it shall <hi>not</hi> bee. That day will never come, nor such a summe of yeares ever expire. Thus sensualitie begulls it selfe with giddie arguments, profane and false. Yeeld them true; Say the world last so long, and that Christ come not till then. Yet particular judgement followes death instant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The soule must suffer torment all the time, untill Christ come. Nay death is cald Christs comming too, one kind of comming. <hi>Ad te venitur, cum vita finitur, Augustine,</hi> Christ comes to <hi>thee,</hi> when thou
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:173124:297"/> departest, judges thy soule then. The day indeede of the worlds generall doome shall adde unto thy paines: because thy body shall then suffer too. But thy anguish in the <hi>interim</hi> shall be so extreme, that hadst thou a tongue, thou shouldst gnaw it in thy torment, and blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme God himselfe through thy unsufferable paines. But Gods sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing of the certaine time, proves not, it will be long, ere Christ will come; bids us expect him rather every day. A bond to pay a debt naming no day, may bee sued when I will. Christ saying hee will come, and not expressing when, may meane as well to morrow, as 5000. winters hence.</p>
            <p>My Text, <hi>Post hoc, judicium,</hi> and after that, judgment, hath haply no verbe purposedly; lest the libertine might take advantage at the tense. But the spirit hath richly provided for this scruple: and though the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite day of Christs comming bee not added; yet that hee will come speedily, Scripture is expresse, many Scriptures. Christs selfe saith, <hi>I come quickly,</hi> saith it three times in one Chapter; twice with a note of demonstration, <hi>behold I come,</hi> and <hi>behold I come;</hi> once with a terme of protestation; <hi>verily I come quickly.</hi> Damnation sleepes not, saith Saint <hi>Peter. The Lord is neere, prope est, Paul</hi> saith. <hi>Praeforibus,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Iames, even at the dore.</hi> The Prophet doubles it. <hi>It is neare, it is neare, Soph.</hi> 1. 7. rests not so; addes it hasts exceedingly; makes Christs <hi>Citò</hi> superlative, <hi>valdè citò.</hi> So is Saint <hi>Austin</hi> too, superlative, saith judgement is <hi>in Proximo. Cyprian</hi> exceeds him, with a grand <hi>Hyperbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le,</hi> Christ is <hi>supra caput,</hi> so neare, that looke but up, you shall see him over your head.</p>
            <p>The Fathers foureteene, fifteene hundred yeares agoe thought it would bee in their dayes. <hi>Tertullian</hi> cald his time, <hi>Clausulum seculi,</hi> the worlds full point. Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> long before him cryed, <hi>Hora novissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> then was the last houre. Then how neare is it now, so many ages after? Surely, the more time is past, the lesser is behinde; and the longer Christ hath stayed, the sooner hee will come. The signes of his comming, foretold by himselfe, not to bee already past, wee are not sure; saving those, which must goe immediatly before it. And who knowes whether this present day shall have any night; or wee, who to day morning arose from our sleepe, shall ever sleepe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: but even before wee part from this place, may heare the last trumpe sound; and the voyce of an Archangell crying in the clouds, <hi>Surgite mortui, venite adjudicium,</hi> Arise you that be dead, and come unto judgement.

The very expectation of that judgement is fearefull, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 27. what will it selfe be? Christs selfe, who shall bee then the Iudge, gives it a fearefull name, calls it, <hi>jud cium gehennae,</hi> the judgement of hell. <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 33.

               </gap>, shooke and trembled for feare. This day ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds that farre. The Iudge will be more terrible to the transgressours of the Law, then hee was then to the receivers of the Law. Gods judgements here are fearefull, though but temporall. Thats cald, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall judgement, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2. The doome there, whether of the just to joyes, or the wicked unto paines, is everlasting. Paines unsufferable, but unavoydable; no ease in them, and yet no end of them. <hi>Dolor, si longus levis; si gravis brevis,</hi> paine is lightly, light if long; short, if great; is a rule, holds not in hell. Darkenesse, gnashing of teeth, bands that breake not, wormes that dye not, fire that goes not out. Thou shalt houle, but none shall heare; roare but none shall helpe; looke round about, but see no comfort; see thy sonne, thy brother, thy friend in the same torment; thou torturd the worse, because by thy cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting them, they came thither.</p>
            <p>Tis fit, wee presse this point, force the beleefe of it. Theres else no living here, no living in this world, if wee thinke, there is no other, and a judgement after death. Which who beleeves not, will make conscience of no sinne. For all Religion is <hi>Animae causa,</hi> for the soules sake, saith Saint <hi>Augustine.</hi> If the soule shall not, not be judged, according to the things it hath done in the body; what will not a man doe, a wicked man? <hi>Edamus, bibamus, Let us eate and drink?</hi> Epicures, are sillie Atheists. Will I doe no more? passe my dayes so poorely, my life so idlely? in base belly cheere, in palate pleasure onely? <hi>Furemur, adulteremur,</hi> I will robbe and ravish; bribe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort; forsweare and murther; stabbe a King; blow up a Parliament house; burne <hi>Dianaes</hi> temple; poyson a whole conclave; set all <hi>Rome</hi> on fire, and sing <hi>Homers</hi> verses while it burnes; <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

            </p>
            <p>To conclude, death scares not sinners, judgement doth. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calls it deaths <hi>Post hoc.</hi> So doth Saint <hi>Iohn, Apocalypse</hi> 6. 8. Deaths

They will then say to thee, <hi>Tua sumus opera</hi> (tis Saint <hi>Bernards</hi> conceit) wee are thy workes, thou hast wrought us: wee will not leave thee, but will bring thee unto judgement.

Thats my theme now. <hi>Blessed are the dead, which dye, &amp;c.</hi> The condition of the righteous after death.</p>
            <p>A proposition, but with an exposition; It had neede; tis not else true. The dead are not all blessed. The voyce addes therefore a clause of inhibition, of restraint: it showes, what dead he meanes, that <hi>dye
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:173124:299"/> in Christ.</hi> First of the proposition, <hi>Blessed are the dead.</hi> Thats a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox in Philosophie, a flat flasehood in Divinitie. For the former; death to be happinesse, a naturall man will nere beleeve it. Some me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholick malecontent may say it haply; none else. The Prince of Philosophers calls life <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the most excellent of all things. <hi>Seneca</hi> seconds him, <hi>Naturae inventum optimum,</hi> the best thing meere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that nature ere devised. What can bee <hi>Melius optimo,</hi> better then the best? Yet one exceeds even this superlative, <hi>Philo</hi> makes more of it, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, good beyond all comparison, hyperbolically good, more then man can conceive. Here and there a man in misery may haply wish death; torment may make men cry, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; preferre death before life. Passion never was good Iudge; even an holy man in moode will pray to dye, <hi>Ionas</hi> did, and <hi>Elias.</hi> Greefe and feare made the one, anger the other. Such are weary indeed, not of life, but of crosse: ease but it, and they will be willing to live still. Nay, a stout spirit will endure torment too rather then dye. <hi>Mecaenas</hi> would say, <hi>Facito debilem pede, facito debilem manu; vita dum superest, bene est,</hi> have foote-goute, hand-gout, any paine whatsoever, let me live, and I will beare it. Onely one or two petty Poets oppose this, hold the dead the happier; I omit them. Let Heathens goe, heare Divines, Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> the Divine here; the Divinitie it selfe, the holy spirit, <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed are the dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then belike theres no hell: or if there be, the worme there gnawes not, and the fire there burnes not. And Christ, that sayd, they doe, and that the rich man there was tormented, made us but beleeve so. Or say, it was so then: yet Christs descēnt to hell harrowed hell, not <hi>Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus Patrum</hi> onely, as Papists say, but <hi>Infantum</hi> too, Purgatory too, thē nethermost hell too. When the voyce bad Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> write this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like all the dead were blessed. For indeede the next word here is <hi>A mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dò,</hi> from henceforth; then and thenceforth <hi>Blessed are the dead.</hi> Then is <hi>Cain</hi> saved, and <hi>Saul,</hi> and <hi>Herod,</hi> and <hi>Achitophel; Iudas</hi> is. Why live we then, many in paine, moe in misery, all in sinne? Why slayes not every man his friend, his selfe? how easily, how soone may a man be happy? doe but dye; and thou art instantly; <hi>Blessed be the dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It skills then that this proposition be restrained; it is not universall, but indefinite, true of many, false of moe; true but <hi>de quibus datur,</hi> of those whom the voyce meanes: It expounds it selfe immediatly, you shall heare anon. The dead are blessed, but not all. Put <hi>Omnes</hi> to it, and tis heresie, a worse heresie, then <hi>Origens.</hi> He held all should bee saved at last; this saves them now, <hi>A modò</hi> instantly. There cannot be a conceipt more absurd. Death came by sinne. <hi>Pelagius</hi> sayd no, but by the law of nature, that <hi>Adam,</hi> though hee never had sinned, yet should have dyed. That heresie was condemned in a solemne <hi>Synod</hi> twelve hundred yeares agoe. I say, God ordained death for sinne; tis sinnes wages Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith. When God told <hi>Adam,</hi> if he eate of the forbidden fruit, he should dye; did hee threaten revenge, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise reward? meant he death for a blessing, or a paine? Saint <hi>Paul</hi> cals it <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a punishment, Saint <hi>Iude</hi> too. Paine so allyed to sinne, that in the Hebrew tongue, one word signifies both: that in <hi>Caines</hi> speech,
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:173124:299"/> the translatour knowes not, whether hee shall English it, <hi>My finne is greater, then can be forgiven,</hi> or <hi>my punishment is greater, then can be borne,</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Sin is every where in Scripture threatned with a woe, with judgement, and destruction. Never was man so mad, as to make death happinesse, as it lookt on Sinne. Accidentally it is: Gods grace and wisedome have turned it to a blessing, unto some, to them in the next clause. But simply it is a curse. How can the dead then be blessed, <hi>qua mortui?</hi> I am too tedious in this terme. The Dead, for sinne des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend to hell; Death and it. <hi>Mors &amp; Infernus,</hi> I find thrice coupled by Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> in the <hi>Apocalypse, death</hi> and <hi>hell.</hi> There is gnawing of tongues, gnashing of teeth. Certainely the dead there are not blessed. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, too much of the proposition.</p>
            <p>Hitherto you haply mervaile what I meane, to take a Text, onely to confute it. Proceed we therefore to the Exposition; that interprets this. <hi>Blessed are the Dead?</hi> What dead? <hi>that die in the Lord.</hi> The Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, because it is not generally true, is cohibited by this clause. The like is in the 145. <hi>Psalme, The Lord is nigh to All, that call on him.</hi> Is that true? tis not. Many pray, that are not heard: <hi>David</hi> therefore addes a cohibitive exposition, <hi>To All, that call upon him faithfully.</hi> So doth the restraint here expound the proposition, those that Die in the Lord. But it selfe needs expounding. The phrase is somewhat darke, and is diversely interpreted, because the preposition is ambiguous. They die in the Lord, that either suffer death for Christ, or end their life in firme faith on him; that suffer Martyrdome, or that Die any way in state of Grace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ribera</hi> a great Iesuite, though he confesse that the common current of expositors runnes with the latter sense, yet is more earnest for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, that Martyrs be meant specially, that (<hi>In</hi>) is put for (<hi>Propter</hi>) as oft in the old Testament. He cites sundry instances, and some also in the New; <hi>In the Lord, i.</hi> for the Lord. I grant it may be: but he should prove, it is. I admit it for one sense, but not the onely one. He were not worthy to have part in Christ, that would doubt of their blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, that doe die for Christ. But that they are Blessed too, that die in Christ, <hi>i.</hi> in faith on him, and hope of Heaven, it seemes even by the Popish Liturgie; in which, this Scripture is read for the Epistle in the daily Masse for the dead. That <hi>Ribera,</hi> and most Romanists, though not daring to deny the other sense, yet are earnest for this, I mervaile not. For that puts out their purgatory fire; the quenching of which, is the starving of Popery. For if not Martyrs onely, but all Beleevers die in Christ, and be blessed: then theres none to be purged. For to frie in that fire, is no blessednesse. The <hi>Rhemists</hi> answer, they are blessed for all that, as being assured to be saved in the end. But the Spirit here provides against that evasion too, addes <hi>A modò,</hi> they are instantly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from all labours, and receive their reward. This is not worth so many wordes.</p>
            <p>First for the former sense; Surely the Martyr is blessed. A point so little doubted, that Saint <hi>Austin</hi> saith, <hi>Injuria est,</hi> they doe the Martyr wrong, that pray for him. For they seeme by that to doubt of his Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: so sure to them that suffer for Christs sake, that the number of
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:173124:300"/> Martyrs under the Romane Emperours is incredible. So many, that Saint <hi>Ierom</hi> saith, 2000. and more are reckoned to every day through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the yeare, save on the first day onely: none might die on it, for <hi>Ianus</hi> sake, first King of <hi>Italy.</hi> The world calles them unhappy. Be it so in their sense; but they are <hi>feliciter infelices,</hi> happy for that unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse, <hi>Augustine.</hi> The world, who (as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith) was not worthy of them, reckons them madde men and fooles; to suffer mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, torture, and death, when they may choose; [<hi>Plura supplicia, quam membra, Cyprian</hi> saith.] But God rewards their temporall paines with eternall waight of glory. And to lose life so, Christ saith, is to find it. <hi>Luther</hi> saith, the Persecutor doth <hi>vitam transferre,</hi> not <hi>auferrc,</hi> doth but exchange their life, helpe them to a better for a worse, a joyfull life in heaven for a painefull life on earth. <hi>Pharaohs</hi> and <hi>Neroes</hi> are against their willes the Martyrs benefactors. They doe (as <hi>Iustin Martyr</hi> wrote to the Emperour,) <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, Kill him, but not hurt him; helpe him, and hasten him rather to heaven. They cry, as the People did at Saint <hi>Paul, Tolle, tolle,</hi> up with him. So God does, takes him to heaven. To end this, Martyrdome is <hi>Amarum,</hi> but <hi>Salubre, Amb.</hi> bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the body, but workes Salvation to the Soule.</p>
            <p>But the Martyr must be sure, that he die <hi>Propter Dominum,</hi> for the faith, for the truth, for the Gospell, in Christs quarrell. Death in a wrong cause is no martyrdome. Papists, saint rebels, and traitors, <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian, Garnet,</hi> and others. They dyed for treason, not for Christ. Suffice this for the former sense; leave it, and heare the latter.</p>
            <p>Martyrs die in the Lord, but not alone; all the Righteous doe. Both antient and moderne interpret the phrase so. All holy men, fearers of God, obeyers of his word, <hi>Die in the Lord,</hi> and are therefore blessed, I may not say, as much, but as well as the Martyrs.</p>
            <p>There are degrees of blessednesse. I will preferre the Martyr before some other Saints. Haply his glory may be more then theirs, because he suffered more then they, Shame, Losse, Death, Torture, for Christ. But I doubt not, but some godly man may be more glorified in heaven, then some Martyr. I thinke Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> no lesse blessed, that died in his bed, then many Saints, who have suffred on the Crosse. The righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous all die in Christ in earth, and raigne with him in heaven. <hi>Tertullian</hi> a learned Father, but not sound, said not well, that <hi>Sanguis Marty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi> is <hi>Clavis Paradisi,</hi> as if none but Martyrs came in heaven. For so he meanes, saith, <hi>tota clavis,</hi> in his phrase, <hi>i. sola clavis,</hi> martyrdome the onely key to Paradise. All others Soules were sequestred, laid up in <hi>Abrahams</hi> bosome, till Christs comming. This he wrote in his zeale to Martyrs, himselfe affecting to be one. I must say of him, as one doth of <hi>Origen,</hi> he was <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, a learned man, but full of errours.</p>
            <p>But what if I should say, that Righteous men are all Martyrs? I know a martyr in common use of speech, meanes one, that seales his witnesse to the Gospell, with his bloud, suffers <hi>death</hi> for Christ. Thats a maytyr <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

<pb n="563" facs="tcp:173124:300"/> holy life. Every true Christian is a Martyr. Say I this onely? Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and ancient Fathers have before me, Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> hath, and Saint <hi>Austin.</hi> A godly mans life, <hi>Tota Martyrium est, Cypr.</hi> Yea Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> hath; To mortifie the flesh (saith he) is one kinde of martyrdome. Nay even <hi>Tertullian</hi> too, calls Confessours of Christ, Martyrs. Theres <hi>Martyrium incruentum,</hi> as well as <hi>Sacrificium:</hi> all Martyrdome craves not bloud.</p>
            <p>I say, not Martyrs onely, in the strict sence, <hi>die in the Lord;</hi> but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie true beleever: faith incorporates into Christ; and whosoever <hi>is</hi> in Christ, <hi>dies</hi> in Christ. He that lives in the Lord, dies in the Lord. Hee that carefully obeyeth Gods Precepts, and faithfully beleeveth his Promises, hee liveth in the Lord. And if in this obedience of the Law, and beleefe of the Gospell, the continue to the end; though the frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the flesh, the allurements of the world, and the suggestions of the Tempter, may haply make him sometimes fall, fall perhappes foulely: yet if he rise againe by repentance, and at his time of his death, with faith fast fixed on Gods promises in Christ, yeeld up his Spirit into the hands of his Redeemer; he dieth in the Lord; and blessed is such a one that so dieth in the Lord. And thats the last terme in my Text, though the first word, <hi>Blessed.</hi> It is the Predicate of the Proposition.</p>
            <p>The Subject of it thus expounded, this remaines. Twas first in place, but last in sense and construction. I meant, not to omit it, but reserved it, to conclude with: as in feasts, the daintiest things are served in last. It is the sweetest word, that the language of men hath, <hi>Iesus</hi> excepted. The sight of God, heaven, comfort, mercy, salvation, sweet words oll: this containes them all. <hi>Blessed, blessed,</hi> saith Christ, eight times toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Blessed they that mourne; for they shall be comforted. Blessed the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull; they shall obtaine mercie. Blessed the pure in heart; they shall see God. Blessed the poore in spirit; theirs is the kingdome of heaven.</hi> Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, a pleasing word, the thing wisht of all men, the <hi>Summum bonum,</hi> end and aime of all Heathens. Blessednesse excells it, a diviner terme, farre sweeter than it. Musicke-sweet to the eare; <hi>Melos in aure,</hi> as Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> saith of <hi>Iesus;</hi> hony-sweet to the mouth, <hi>Mel in ore; Iubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum in corde,</hi> for want of a better word, he takes that, the delight of it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ravishes the heart.</p>
            <p>The Object of the Blessed in Gods Booke is manifold. Christs eight <hi>Beatitudes</hi> in the Gospell, have almost as many severall respects: some blessed for this cause, some for that. The dead here in the Lord, Why, or how are they blessed? Thats a wide and a deepe Ocean; the time too short, and mans wit to shallow for this Theme. This Verse shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine me. It affords two Reasons, why the dead in Christ are blessed, their Rest, and their Reward. Theres but one little clause betwixt my Text, and them; <hi>They rest from their labours, and their Workes follow them.</hi> A word of each, and I end; I have treated of them amplely here before.</p>
            <p>For the one, the labours of mans life are infinite, by the browes sweat to earne our bread; the worlds molestations, the lusts inquietations, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans solicitations. By death he hath a <hi>Quietus est</hi> from All; no man hath before; not the sonne of man himselfe. He was a foole, God calls him
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:173124:301"/> so, that said to his soule, <hi>Requiesce,</hi> while he lived. <hi>Requiems</hi> be Funerall Anthems. Theres a soules rest indeede in <hi>Ieremie,</hi> and in the Gospell, <hi>Matth. 11. 29. Requiem animabus,</hi> by godly life, and holy faith. Thats but peace of conscience, an internall rest. But a totall release from all disquie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, even of the body too, a rest from all labours, is not had in this life. For man (<hi>Iob</hi> saith) is borne to labours; <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, wee are (Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith) ordained to it, <hi>Vita perpetua Crux.</hi> Death is the sole and finall discharge from all disturbance.</p>
            <p>For the other, Workes here by Metonymie meane Reward, as else where often. It is so glossed plainely in <hi>Boaz</hi> speach to <hi>Ruth, The Lord render thee thy worke,</hi> and a reward be given thee. For Gods reward is according to mans worke: thats frequent in Scripture. Not that workes merit; but because they come from faith, which makes Christs merits ours. Their reward is our salvation, <hi>i.</hi> eternall life and glory. This shall follow them, that die in Christ. Not follow afarre off, which Papists grant, but say, Fire must purge us first, Purgatorie fire. But the Spirit here saith, <hi>A modò,</hi> immedialty. Or because they elude that word many wayes; the phrase here meanes better, than it is translated, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, their workes, not follow, but, goe with them. The words well weighed sound so. This is the blessednesse of the godly, when they die, admirably great, remove from restlesse labours unto endlesse joyes, and infallibly sure: the Spirit saies it, biddes write it, even Gods Spirit, the holy Ghost; <hi>Cui cum Patre, &amp;c.</hi>

The Lord in the first dawning of the world, put enmitie
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:173124:302"/> between the Serpent and his Seed, and the Woman and her Seed. Sathan was the Serpent, and his Seed are the ungodly. The Womans Seed was Christ, and his members, all beleevers. The Dragon and his children have alwayes fought against God and his children: sometime by poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and allurements, as <hi>Balak</hi> had preferments for <hi>Balaam</hi> to curse <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> and the Scribes 30. silver peeces for <hi>Iudas</hi> to betray his master: and sometime by maine force, as the Iewes had scourges for the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles backes, <hi>Paschur</hi> had stockes for <hi>Ieremies</hi> feete, and <hi>Iezabel</hi> an Axe for <hi>Elias</hi> head.</p>
            <p>For Sathan being the Prince of this world Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, the God of the world, he saith too, and chalenging the gift of all the kingdomes thereof, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4. 6. cannot abide Gods Church to bee in his dominions: but first assaieth by temptations to make it his; and if they faile, then by persecutions to roote it out. So that there hath beene in all ages continuall warre in the Church, either to pervert or to subvert the Saints on earth, either to make them of the world, or to thrust them out of the world. Now such as having manfully stood in Gods field a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the enemies of his truth, and fought courageously under Christs ensigne in defense of the faith, have at last lost their lives in the quarrell of the Gospel, willingly offering their heads unto the blocke, or their hearts unto the sword, yea their whole bodies unto the fires of the persecutour, these are sayd more specially to dye in the Lord, and blessed are these men. For their bodies yeelding up the ghost in earth, sendeth up their spirits a sweet smelling Sacrifice into heaven: where for the momentany lightnesse of their afflictions in this world, shall be given them in the world to come a far most excellent eternall waight of glory. Here they received doome of death from the Iudge; there they shall receive a crowne of life from God. For the blood of Martyrs is the key of Paradise, <hi>Tert.</hi> He meant not soundly, but we may; and he that loseth his life for my sake, shall finde it, saith Christ.</p>
            <p>These most kindly indeed <hi>Dye in the Lord.</hi> But they also dye <hi>in</hi> him, that retaine constant faith to the last gaspe of breath. And therefore S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> makes two sorts of martyrdome; one the confession of Christ with our blood; the other the profession of his Gospell by good workes. To moderate wrath, to master lust, to represse avarice, to humble pride, <hi>pars magna martyrii est,</hi> is a great part of martyrdome, Saint <hi>August.</hi> That wee may bee called Martyrs, and sayd to dye in the Lord, not onely by bearing witnesse to the Gospell by our death, but also by subscribing to the Law by our life. For they that live in the Lord, doe also dye in the Lord. Hee that carefully obeyeth Gods precepts, and assuredly beleeveth his promises, he liveth in the Lord. And if in this obedience of the Law, and beleefe of the Gospell, hee continue to the end: though the frailtie of the flesh, the allurements of the world, and the suggestions of the tempter may haply sometimes make him fall, fall perhaps foulely: yet if he rise againe by repentance, and at the time of his death, with faith fast fixed on Gods promises in Christ, yeeld up his soule into the hands of his Redeemer, hee dieth also in the Lord; and blessed is such an one, that so dyeth in the Lord. I leave this first point.</p>
            <pb n="567" facs="tcp:173124:302"/>
            <p>The second is the testimony of the holy Ghost, meant here by the <hi>Spirit.</hi> I might observe two things in it; one, the truth of the witnesse, the other, the difference betweene the verdict of God, and the opinion of the world. But the former I omit; no man doubts of Gods truth. For the latter; Martyrdome, the speciall kind of <hi>dying in the Lord,</hi> hath lightly three things in it, shame, torture and death, all three enemies to flesh and blood. For shame; the malefactour sentenced by the Iudge to suffer open discipline, will be well content, either to fine halfe his worth, to redeeme the same, or to have his stripes doubled trebled, so it may bee in secret. For torture, the stoutest spirit will shrinke at paine, and the sense of exquisite torment will force the strongest hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted man, to cry out like a woman in her travell. For death, the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant in a tempest, be his fraight never so pretious, will cast it out, to save himselfe. The devill though a lyar, yet in this he sayd truth, <hi>that a man will give all that he hath for his life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the Martyr not mooved with any of these respects, refuseth none of these three; but willingly yeeldeth himselfe unto death, bee it never so shamefull, be it never so painefull. The Infidell, or Atheist noting his resolution, esteemeth his estate to be wretched and unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, and the person himselfe to be out of his wits. The sensuall Epicure, that placeth his happinesse in life, pleasure, &amp; ease, and reckoneth death to bee the mainest evill, especially when ignominie and torment beē joyned with it, judgeth the Martyr a meere mad man. Hee waigheth not the cause, which is Christs quarrell, but looketh onely on the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment. And indeede, were it not that hee dyed in the defence of Faith, he were of all men the most miserable. But the verdict of Gods spirit is much differing from the worlds opinion; and pronounceth them happy, that dye in the Lord. <hi>Blessed are they</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>that suffer persecution for righteousnesse sake. For he that loseth his life for the Gospell shall finde it.</hi> Yea hee shall gaine by his losse. For hee lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth but a temporall life, and that sowred with much sorrow: but hee shall finde an eternall life, and that full of all joyes, in the kingdome of heaven.</p>
            <p>But to come to the second kind of dying in the Lord, which is after the long leading of an holy life, the happy attaining to a godly death. For he that liveth in Gods feare, shall dye in God favour. It is a plaine, but a true proverbe, <hi>Qualis vita, finis ita.</hi> For as it is sayd of the sinner, who after dissembled repentance falls into relapse of his wickednesse, that the end of that man is worse then the beginning: so it is as true of the good Christian, that remembring his Creatour in the dayes of his youth, and growing up in vertue, and Religion, as he grew in yeares, at length departeth in the faith of his Saviour, that the end of that man is more blessed, then his beginning. Now how differs the worlds judgement, and spirits concerning these? doe they better agree here?</p>
            <p>The profession of Christ and of the Gospell in the primitive Church seemed to the Gentiles a notable sottishnesse, and was therefore perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted in all places, and Christians accounted the scumme of the earth, in Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> phrase, the off-scouring of the world. Not onely Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:173124:303"/> in the time of the Law, and Apostles, of the Gospell, and now the Preachers of both, were and are esteemed of irreligious Atheists, and profane Christians, mad men and idiots: as <hi>Iehu's</hi> ruffianly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions sayd of one, wherefore came that mad fellow? and <hi>Festus</hi> to <hi>Paul, thou art beside thy selfe:</hi> but in every private Christian, the more zealous profession of Religion is counted folly; and to be wise and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise together is thought a thing impossible. Wisedome is put in riches, in honour, in policie, in Princes favours, in providing for the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of our names, by leaving our lands to our posteritie, and much substance to our children. Godlinesse is left for the dregs of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and for the meane wits of base and simple men. And though in our Christian Common wealths, partly for feare of severity of lawes, and partly through the great light of the Gospel, preached so many yeares, and in so many places, there are but few found, that denying God, and defying all Religion, say with the Sadducees, that there is no resurrection: yet the leud lives of the greater part of Christians, bewray our secret opinions: to wit, that Religion is but a meere policie, to keepe men in awe; and that neither happinesse standeth in living in Gods feare, nor blessednesse consisteth in dying in his faith: That the young man is to rejoyce in his youth, and to let his heart bee merry in his greene yeares, to injoy all the pleasures of his eyes, and to walke in all the lusts of his heart: and that the old man is to cherish his age, and to take his ease in his gray hayres; to injoy the world, while his dayes doe last, and to eate and drinke, for to morrow hee shall dye: that it is a vanity to serve the Lord, and there is not profit in obeying of his Lawes. Thus saith the world.</p>
            <p>Now what saith the <hi>spirit? Godlinesse is profitable every way, 1 Tim. 4. hath the promises of both this life, and of the life to come.</hi> Askes the worldling in <hi>Iob, what gaine is there got by being godly?</hi> The Spirit answers in the <hi>Psalme, Verily there is a reward for the righteous.</hi> This point needs pressing more then proofe. The fearefull examples of the wicked, when they dye, and their consciences, while yet they live, doe yeeld cleare evidence to the spirits testimony.</p>
            <p>For the former, the book of Scripturs, and the history of the Church, are as it were two great offices of record, wherein are enrolled infinite instances of this kind. To let Church story passe, because you are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter acquainted with the Bible, <hi>Herod</hi> in the <hi>Acts,</hi> and <hi>Anti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Nay when he was dead, his body could not hold them; but they so raged within him, that hee burst asunder, and his bowels gushed out. Come to the other evidence, their owne conscience.</p>

            <p>yet at least his, as well as Christs. That is often, <hi>Grace and Peace from God the Father, and the Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> The Father is the spring of it, and the Sonne is the meanes of it, <hi>à Patre,</hi> but <hi>per Filium.</hi> That Grace meanes Mercy and Goodnesse. But Christs Grace here, some will have to meane Christs merits, all the benefits of his Obedience. It is worth the wishing, Mans whole Redemtion. But then heres an other <hi>Soloecisme,</hi> Order is broke againe, and worse then before. Be Saint <hi>Paul</hi> pardoned, in that he put Christ first, the Father after him; because in Trinity is no Priority. It is all one to the three Persons, who is named first. But betweene the Love of God, and the grace of Christ, as we construed it, there is Priority. Gods Love is the Ancienter: Christs grace came after it. First, the Fathers Love elected us; and then the Sonnes sufferings redeemed us. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> therefore plainely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts order here. For Gods Love is the cause of Christs grace, and should therefore be put first: for the Cause precedes the effect, Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures may seeme to oppose one another.</p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, there was enmity betweene God and us, till Christ had reconciled us. So should Christs grace seeme first. Christs selfe saith crosse to that, <hi>that God so loved the World, that he gave his onely Sonne;</hi> first <hi>Loved,</hi> and then <hi>Gave.</hi> So is Gods Love the former. I finde some expositors, curious in according these two Scriptures. But I thinke grace and love to be here but <hi>Synonymaes.</hi> I wish not to be more acute, then the Apostle. And as grace sometimes is ascribed unto the Father, so is Love unto the Sonne. To end this, Grace is the gift. It being but one word, why are so many names heaped on the Giver? The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his grace is well worthy of them all. I will not examine them; you have heard them oft expounded.</p>
            <p>The second is Gods Love. Say, Grace and Love be one; yet Christ and God is not. O Hereticke? would a Papist cry, Christ and God not one? thats Arianisme; Is not Christ, God? He is. yet Christ and God here are not one. For God here meanes the Father, does so often. Though in the sacred Trinity, every Person be God, and the Word (God) in Scripture doe mostly meane all Three: yet the terme sometimes singles out one alone. <hi>Heb. 1. 1. God spake unto the Patriarkes,</hi> thats God the Father. 1 <hi>Tim 3. God manifested in the flesh;</hi> thats God the Sonne, <hi>Act. 5. 4. Thou hast lyed unto God;</hi> thats to God the Holy Ghost.

To take hint here to treate of the Trinity, of their Personall proprieties, and consubstantiality, were but digres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; or if seasonable, not much profitable, points too darke for many here. Onely Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> zeale to the Churches generall good would <hi>Obiter</hi> be observed: that whereas in all other his <hi>Epistles,</hi> saving this, he commends the Churches, unto which he writes, to the <hi>Grace</hi> of Christ onely; here he conjoynes with Christ, God and the Holy Spirit, all the Persons of the Deity. They are safe <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, thrice safe, that have such Keepers, such, and so many.</p>

               <hi>Iacob</hi> trusts <hi>Iosephs</hi> Sonnes to the blessing of an Angell, <hi>Gen.</hi> 48. A Romanist thinkes a Saint sufficient to preserve him, especially if Christs Mother. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> wrote to <hi>Romanes,</hi> but never taught them that: he
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:173124:304"/> commended them to Christ, to the grace of the <hi>Lord Iesus.</hi> So doēs he all the Churches, not to Gods Mother, but to Gods Sonne; not to Gods Angell, but to Gods Selfe. Yea here, not to one Person onely, though that would have sufficed, but joyntly to all three, Father, Sonne, and Holy Ghost. If Christ could say, <hi>Father, of those whom thou hast given me, I have not lost one:</hi> they are sure to be safe, who be kept by all the Persons. Indeed by one, as well as by them all, by any one, as well as by all three. But it sounds to sense more sweetly, to foolish flesh and blood, by All, then by one onely. If some weake-witted Christian, that did not conceive the parity of the Persons, hearing Christ call his Father <hi>greater</hi> then himselfe, <hi>Pater major me est,</hi> and that the Holy Ghost doth but proceed from them, would wish God the Father to take the charge of him: even such a seely Soule Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth here satisfie by the Love of God the Father.</p>
            <p>Now what is that Love? His Grace, his Goodnesse, his Patience, his Mercy. His Grace; for it is free. Thou hast not bought it, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served it. Merit is the idlest opinion in all Popery. His Goodnesse, for it is bountifull, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> terme, exceedes for Amplitude, in all dimensions, bredth, length, depth, and heighth, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3. 18. Such, as you may cry of it, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> does of Gods Wisdome, <hi>O Altitudo!</hi> His Patience, for he forbeares to punish. His Mercy; for he pardons all our sinnes. Its not that Love, that first elected us, before the world, foreordained us to Salvation; but a sprigge springing from it; crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning us with all blessings. Nor yet that his generall Love, common to the Reprobates, conferring many favours even on them. But his espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall kindnesse, in keeping from us nothing that is good, in guiding, in preserving, in blessing and assisting us. [There is a Love of God too, not meant here; for the phrase suffers two senses, may meane either actively from God to man, or passively from man to God. Our Love to God, as well as Gods to us, is called the Love of God. The Passive sense is not meant here; it were non-sense.]</p>
            <p>To end this; the things of God are many, usefull to us too, Gods Power, his Wisdome, his Iustice, and his Truth. But as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> said of <hi>our</hi> Love, Now abide, Faith, Hope, and Love, these three; but the greatest of these is Love: so will I say of Gods, the things of God are many, but the sweetest is his Love. So sweete, not unto us onely, but also to himselfe, that he makes it his owne name. <hi>God is Love,</hi> saith the Apostle. Christ said, <hi>Ego sum Veritas,</hi> but God cries, <hi>Ego sum Charitas.</hi> God hath many excellencies; but they All are in this One. If I call him King, I show his Glory; if Lord, his Power; if Iudge; his Iustice, saith a Greeke Father. But if I call him Love, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, I call him All. What doth the Lord require of thee (saith <hi>Moses</hi>) more then thy Love? What can Saint <hi>Paul</hi> commend thee to, commend the Church of God unto, more then to Gods Love? Barely to God? thats too generall; we doe so one another, bid but <hi>Adieu</hi> onely, God be with you. [Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did the Elders of <hi>Ephesus</hi> in the <hi>Acts, And now</hi> (Brethren) <hi>I commend you to God.</hi> Nay, we doe not so much, bid but Farewell onely, name not God. Heathens did that, <hi>Valete,</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> does that too in this Chapter <hi>ver. 11. Fare ye well;</hi> wrote to the
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:173124:304"/> men of <hi>Corinth</hi> in their owne phrase; they were but newly wonne from Gentilisme. But he rested not (you see) in that, concludes in a more Christian forme, with the words of my Text.] Onely to the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie? So is our style too in our letters. That haply meanes somewhat more, insinuates Gods power. But <hi>Gratius est nomen pietatis, quàm po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testatis, Tert.</hi> the terme of love, is sweeter than of power. Not sweeter onely, but also of more force to confirme faith. For power is coucht in love; love is not so in power. Not what God <hi>can</hi> doe, that he <hi>will;</hi> but what God <hi>will</hi> doe, that he <hi>can; Domine, si vis, potes,</hi> saith the <hi>Leper.</hi> Gods love, alone is enough to be commended to. I have beene long in this, long in Gods Love; God hold me ever in it, and you all.</p>
            <p>The third is the <hi>Communion of the Holy Ghost.</hi> Hee is God as well as the Father, and the Sonne Saint <hi>Paul</hi> here calls but one of them so onely. Which with some other Scriptures, hath stumbled many Heretickes, hinted them to denie both the other to be God. Simplicitie of infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie doe cause some <hi>Quaeres</hi> here; which I will not argue, but touch onely. I would not doe so much, but that they come not often. The first is, <hi>An sit,</hi> Is there such a thing? Some disciples in the <hi>Acts,</hi> tell <hi>Paul,</hi> they had not heard of any holy Ghost. But thats meant <hi>metonymicè,</hi> most Expositors say, of the gifts, the extraordinarie gifts of the holy Ghost. The second is <hi>Quis,</hi> who he is, or rather first, <hi>Quid,</hi> what it is? For of old, <hi>Samosatenus,</hi> and <hi>Servetus</hi> but of late, have held, hee is no substance, but an Act onely, Gods <hi>Energeia,</hi> his working power in us. The Angells speech to <hi>Marie</hi> seemes to sound so, <hi>Luke <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">

The holy Ghost shall come unto thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee.</hi> Say, Person; yet a Creature, the blasphemie of <hi>Arius</hi> and <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donius.</hi> They denied him to be God, called him in scorne <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>, <hi>Naz.</hi> an unwritten God; Scripture makes him none, they say, falsely say. Grant him God; yet the same Person with Christ and the Father. Yeeld him distinct from both, a third Person; yet another God. Some Heretickes held three Gods the <hi>Tritheitae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some jeered and jested <hi>Lucian</hi>-like; hearing, he proceeded from the Father, called him therefore his sonne, and so Christs brother. But hearing he proceeded from the Sonne too, they called God his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father. These are the <hi>Arian</hi> blasphemies in <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>thanasius</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius.</hi> Some have profanely made him of feminine sexe, and called him Christs sister.</p>
            <p>His title here hath two termes, Holy, and Spirit. Each apart belongs to both the other Persons. <hi>God is a Spirit,</hi> saith Christ; and the <hi>Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phims</hi> in <hi>Esay</hi> crie, <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy,</hi> one Holy to each Person. But put them both together; then they spell the third Person alone by himselfe. Yet are Angells called so too, holy Spirits; and so are Saints. For what are soules, but Spirits? And what meanes Saints but holy? But the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost is titled so <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, highly with an Article, for distinction, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the Spirit; yea two Articles, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the Spirit, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit.</p>
            <p>First, why a Spirit? Because he is breathed from the Father, and the Sonne, proceeds from both; called therefore by Saint <hi>Augustine, Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Amborum;</hi> the Spirit of them both, Of the one, <hi>It is not you that
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:173124:305"/> speake,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>but the Spirit of your Father.</hi> Of the other, <hi>God sent the Spirit of his Sonne,</hi> saith the Apostle. I said, a Spirit, because brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed from God. From the Father, <hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>Psal. 33. Spiritu oris ejus, omnis virtus eorum, the hoast of heaven by the breath of his mouth;</hi> Saint <hi>Basil</hi> and <hi>Cyril</hi> say, he meanes the holy Ghost. From the Sonne, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Wohm the Lord Iesus will confound with the breath of his mouth, Oecum.</hi> and <hi>Genadus</hi> say, he meanes so too. Angells, mens soules, and winds, and some moe things are called spirits, but created spirits all. But this spirit is no creature. The great Councell of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> defind him to be God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, why Holy? Not <hi>Ob sanctitatem Immanentem,</hi> the Schooles terme, for holinesse in himselfe; the Father and the Sonne, both have that also, but rather <hi>Emanantem,</hi> the Holinesse, he workes in man. Both doe distinguish him from Sathan, a Spirit too, but <hi>Immundus,</hi> an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane Spirit and unholy, both <hi>subjectivè &amp; effectivè,</hi> workes all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanenesse and unholinesse in man. The holy Ghost doth the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: as himselfe is holy, so makes he us so to, called therefore by S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>the sanctifying Spirit;</hi> for all sanctification is from him.</p>
            <p>But what meanes the <hi>Communion</hi> of the holy Ghost? Thats in my Text the hardest terme. Christs <hi>Grace,</hi> the first thing here, and the <hi>Love</hi> of God, the second, are in estimable mercies, even mans heaven on earth, his hight of happinesse here. They give and grant them us; but their seisin and deliverie is by the holy Ghost. The Concession is from them; but he puts us in Possession. They Collate, but he Inducts. [Father and Sonne doe dwell in holy men, as well as the Spirit, Christ saith it. Why? Because they both worke in the faithfull by the Spirit.] Their gifts and Graces are conveighed to them by him. He is <hi>Digitus Dei,</hi> Gods finger, saith Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> his hand, to reach us all Gods blessings. Hence have Divines called him Gods <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Gods Vertue and his power. The enlightening of the Mind, the enclining of the Will, the enkindling of the heart, is all his operation. The Sonne Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciles us to his Father offended. That Reconciliation the Spirit as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures to us, and seales unto our soules the pardon of our sinnes. All the Churches good, it is from God, from all the Persons joyntly. But the <hi>Communicatio,</hi> that is, the Distribution, the dole of it to every man is by the holy Ghost. This <hi>Grace, Love,</hi> and <hi>Communion,</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> wisheth to the Church, to be <hi>with the Corinthians, Vobiscum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Will Saint <hi>Paul</hi> wish Pearles to Swine, holy things to Dogges, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>? Gods Loue is a Pearle, Grace an holy thing: and drunken men are Swine, uncleane Persons Dogges. Will he bid <hi>Salvere</hi> in the front of his <hi>Epistles</hi> and <hi>valere</hi> in the foot of it, to Schismatickes and Heretickes. Tis against S. <hi>Iohns</hi> rule, <hi>Bid not such an one, God speed.</hi> S. <hi>Pauls</hi> selfe saith more, <hi>Haereticum hominem devita,</hi> avoid the Hereticke, nay, <hi>Devita,</hi> take his life from him, by some Papists construction, burne him at a stake. Such were these <hi>Corinthians;</hi> Schismaticks, I am <hi>Pauls,</hi> I am <hi>Apollos,</hi> I am <hi>Cephas,</hi> I am <hi>Christs.</hi> Heretickes, grand heretickes; they denied the Resurrection. Some of them drunken, and that at the Lords Supper. Fornication there too, Incestuous fornication, thats farre worse: the highest Incest too, such as is not among Heathens, a man to have his
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:173124:305"/> Fathers wife. [<hi>Scelus inauditum, Tully</hi> calls it, and incredible.] Is Saint <hi>Paul</hi> so solicitous to salute such with <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Peace?</hi> And to commend such to <hi>the Love of God,</hi> and <hi>the Grace of the Lord Iesus?</hi> I could muster moe sinnes, enormous sinnes of theirs, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 10.</p>
            <p>But heare there the Apostles charitable charge, and <hi>such</hi> (saith hee) <hi>were some of you.</hi> See how he salves the sore. They were but <hi>some,</hi> not many; and the some, but <hi>were,</hi> not are. Some sinners in so great a citie, no great wonder. Among Christs twelve Disciples was one <hi>Iudas;</hi> in <hi>Noahs</hi> Arke but eight persons, one <hi>Cham;</hi> of but foure in <hi>Adams</hi> family, one <hi>Cain;</hi> of but two in <hi>Rebecchaes</hi> wombe, one <hi>Esau.</hi> And tis <hi>eratis,</hi> they were, they had beene such. Who hath not beene a sinner.—<hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel insanivimus omnes.</hi> But they were now washed, justified, sanctified. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> grievously chargeth them, but as graciously dischargeth them; and that at once, accuseth and quitteth them both with one breath. Say they were such yet still: yet were Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> wish here warrantable. Christs Grace, Gods Love, and the working of the Spirit, as the faithfull neede them, to confirme them; so the sinnefull want them, to convert them.</p>
            <p>Lastly, tis <hi>Vobis omnibus,</hi> the blessing, which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> wisheth them, is <hi>unto them all.</hi> He excepts not the Schismatickes, though they preferred <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Apollos</hi> before him: not the Incestuous person, though before he had censured him with excommunication. They had repented All, and therefore hee commends them All, to the Grace of <hi>the Lord Iesus, and to the Love of God, and to the sweet Communion of the holy Ghost.</hi> And that with an <hi>Amen:</hi> not saith it onely, signes it too, even from his soule. Vnto these three sacred Persons of the blessed Deitie, be joyntly ascribed all honour, &amp;c.</p>
